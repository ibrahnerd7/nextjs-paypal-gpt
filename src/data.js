`Why is my withdrawal being held for review? To provide a secure online payment service, our system automatically reviews every withdrawal before it's released. We may hold some withdrawals for up to 72 hours for further review. This review can happen for various reasons. For example, we may review the transfer if you’ve received an unusually large payment or if you’ve logged in from an unsecured network.
Why does my withdrawal need to be reviewed?
Withdrawals may be flagged for review due to a combination of factors. Some common reasons include:

Unusual account activity: Large or higher-than-normal payments preceding the withdrawal.
Untrusted networks: Logging in from unsecured or unfamiliar devices/networks.
Account status: Incomplete account verification or recent account limitations.
Withdrawal details: Discrepancies or errors in information provided when linking a bank account/debit card.
What to expect if your withdrawal is reviewed 
Holds and reviews typically last no more than 72 hours.
In some cases, reviews may resolve sooner if our system can process the withdrawal without manual intervention.
While your withdrawal is held for review:
Check your email: We'll notify you if any action is needed or if there's an update on your withdrawal.
Review your account: Ensure your payment methods (e.g., linked bank accounts, debit cards) are correctly entered and verified.
Verify activity: Check if recent transactions align with typical patterns on your account. If activity looks unusual, update your account details or contact us for assistance.
Once the review is complete, your withdrawal status will update to "Completed," and regular transfer timeframes will apply. Learn more about regular timeframes for withdrawals.
What happens if my withdrawal is declined?
In rare cases, a withdrawal may be declined rather than delayed. Learn about reasons for a declined withdrawal and what to do.

Fast Facts
How long will a withdrawal be held for review?
Most withdrawal reviews are resolved within 72 hours or sooner, but delays may occur depending on the situation.

Will PayPal notify me if my withdrawal is under review?
Yes, we'll email you if your withdrawal is held for review, detailing any next steps required.

How can I cancel my withdrawal?
Withdrawals can’t be canceled under any circumstances.`,

How do I activate my PayPal Debit Card 5% monthly cash back?
To find and activate your PayPal Debit Card 5% monthly cash back category offer in the app:

Tap Accounts.
Tap Choose your monthly cash back category (you must have a PayPal Debit Card to choose a category).
Select the cash back category that you would like to activate for the current month and tap Next.
When the category offer details are shown, tap Got it.
*Please ensure that you've updated your PayPal app to the latest version.




Do I have to activate my 5% monthly cash back category PayPal Debit Card offer?

Yes, you’ll need to choose a 5% monthly cash back category offer each month. Your selected monthly category will expire at the end of each month and you’ll need to log into your PayPal app to choose a category offer each month, even if you select the same category.

Are there any limits to the amount of cash back that I can receive for my 5% monthly cash back category offer?

Yes. Customers who have activated the 5% cash back monthly category feature can earn PayPal Rewards Points (that can be redeemed for cash or other options) on up to $1,000 of spend with their Card in their selected monthly rewards category during a calendar month (up to $50 cash equivalent once redeemed).

How can I combine the PayPal Debit Card 5% monthly cash back category rewards with merchant offers?

To maximize your rewards, you can combine the 5% cash back from your PayPal Debit monthly category with merchant offers in the same category found in the PayPal app when you checkout with PayPal.

For example, if you’ve activated your 5% cash back category on clothing, it can be combined with a cash back offer from a clothing store when you use your PayPal Debit Card during PayPal Checkout, so you can earn even more cash back on the purchase.

Here's how to combine your rewards:

Activate a 5% monthly cash back category (see above).
Log in to the PayPal app and shop store offers in the same category.
Use your PayPal Debit Card in PayPal Checkout.

How do I open a dispute with a seller?
Contacting the seller is often the best way to solve a problem. You can find their contact details by going to your Activity and selecting the payment. They may be able to issue a refund or help with a return.

Here's how to open a dispute from the web:

Issues with your purchase (a purchase doesn’t arrive or match the seller’s description).
Issues with the Seller (a seller is not co-operating and doesn’t respond to your messages, or you're simply unable to reach an agreement).
Billing errors or Issues with subscriptions (you've been charged more than once).
Select the option that best describes your issue and click Continue.

Go to Activity and tap the transaction you want to report.

By escalating a dispute to a claim, you’re asking PayPal to investigate and decide the outcome. A dispute will automatically close after 20 days unless it’s been escalated. Closed disputes cannot be reopened or escalated to a claim.

What’s an “authorization” and can I cancel it?
When you authorize a payment to a merchant, you agree to make a purchase for a specified amount. Your account will show a “Pending” authorization until the merchant captures the payment. Once a merchant processes the order, they capture the payment and charge your account. The payment will show as ‘"Complete” and the merchant will ship the item.

Once an order is placed, it’s not possible to change the payment amount or number of items purchased.

Neither you nor PayPal can cancel an order, but the merchant might be able to cancel it for you. If you need to cancel an order or authorization, please contact the merchant.

To see the seller’s contact details:

Go to Activity.
Select the payment.
Use the contact information on this page to contact the seller.
Tips: 

Orders and authorizations typically expire in 29 days. Authorizations are sometimes for a future payment, for example a hotel stay or reservation.

Can I cancel a withdrawal from my PayPal account?
Why can’t a withdrawal be canceled?
Once you initiate a withdrawal from your PayPal account, it cannot be canceled. This is because our automated system processes withdrawals immediately to securely and efficiently complete your transfer.

If you made a mistake and need your money back in PayPal, you can initiate a new transfer from your bank to your PayPal balance.

What are my options if there’s an error or I need the money back?
If you made a mistake with your withdrawal or need the money returned to your PayPal account, you have a few options:

Wait for the transfer to complete: Most standard bank transfers and debit card withdrawals clear within 1–3 business days. Once the money reaches your account, you can transfer it back to PayPal with a linked bank account or debit card. Learn how to add money to your PayPal balance.
Request your bank’s assistance: If the withdrawal hasn’t been completed yet, you can contact your bank to inquire whether reversing the transaction is an option. Some banks may allow reversals depending on their policies.
The transfer might fail: If the transfer fails due to issues like incorrect information, the funds may automatically return to your PayPal account. A return fee might apply in this case. Learn how to check on the status of your withdrawal.
`,
`
Can I cancel a money transfer from my bank to my PayPal account?
Once you authorize a transfer from your bank account to your PayPal account, you can't cancel it.

Once the money is in your PayPal Balance or PayPal Business account, you can transfer it back to your bank. Just go to your Transfer Money page.
`,
`
What’s an Order and why is it pending?
An order is an agreement between a buyer and a seller. It authorizes a seller to debit a buyer's PayPal account for their purchase.

A "Pending" order status means that the seller received your order but hasn’t collected your payment yet.

Once you place an order, your account will show a “Pending” authorization until the seller captures your payment. Once a seller processes your order, they capture the payment and charge your account. The payment will show as “Complete” and the seller then sends the item.

The status of your order appears in your account Activity under "Payment status."

Sellers will often complete the order within a few days. Most sellers will complete for goods payments when they’re ready to ship your item. For services, rentals, or hotel stays, sellers will complete the payment once they’ve fully delivered your purchased service.

An order status can display as pending for up to 30 days. That is until it’s expired, completed, or the seller voids it.

There are several possible statuses:

“Pending”: The seller hasn’t accepted the payment yet. Some sellers wait until you receive the item before they accept the payment.
“In Progress”: The seller accepted a partial payment amount.
“Complete”: The seller accepted the entire payment amount.
“Voided”: The seller canceled the payment.
“Expired”: A payment automatically expires after 30 days. Contact the seller if you would like to rearrange payment.
“Denied”: Your bank or card issuer denied the charge for an order. Please contact your bank or card issuer for decline details. Contact the seller to create a new order.

Can I cancel an eCheck payment?
Only the sender can cancel a pending eCheck, which they can do by contacting their bank.

Why is my payment on hold or unavailable?
We may hold payments for various reasons based on the account's activity. Log in to your account and click on Know your options under your PayPal balance to learn why we are holding your payment and how you can release it.

You’re a new seller with PayPal or an established seller who has opened a new account.

Unusual selling patterns include an unexpected surge in sales, a change in business type, a change in average selling price, or the type of item being sold.
You’re selling higher-risk items. 

Higher-risk items can include event tickets, consumer electronics, travel packages, and gift cards.
You’ve received a payment for goods and services instead of payment for friends and family.

The sender selected "For goods and services" instead of "For friends and family” as a payment type. You should get your money 7 days after confirming the order status as Completed.

Go to your Activity.

New PayPal account – payments on hold and accessing your money quicker
Congratulations on your recent sale! 
We’re excited you’ve chosen PayPal to process your payments. Let’s get started with how selling on PayPal works, what you should expect and how we manage access to your money as you get started. 

As a new seller or someone who hasn’t sold in a while, we want to ensure you’re able to serve your customers with the high standards they deserve. At the same time, we want to protect you, as a seller, as you navigate how payments work. We require you to confirm your identity, and we monitor your performance as a seller. 

As you begin your selling journey, or start selling after a while, we hold the initial payments you receive for up to 21 days. This is a common industry practice to cover any potential buyer complaints that may happen in that time.  

To review your payment(s) on hold, log in to your account and click on Know your options under your PayPal balance.

How do I get access to my money? 
We review sellers' accounts each month to see if some/all sales proceeds can become available immediately. Once you build a positive selling history on your account and confirm your identity, we’ll give you access to your money faster. 


I have access to some money instantly, how can I get access to more? 
You can access a monthly release limit for payments received, and payments will be released until this limit is reached. When the limit for the month is reached, the next payments will be put on hold for up to 21 days.


To access this option, please:
• Have an active and confirmed bank account or card;
• Have your cell phone as your primary phone, active and confirmed.

We will also ask you to complete some or all of the following steps:
• Achieve a specified number of sales/orders;
• Receive a specified total amount of sales;
• Not receive disputes from buyers for a specified period of days;
• Not having any kind of active limitation.

Once you have access to a monthly release limit for payments received, you can request an analysis to increase this limit every 30 days, and generally, the response is immediate.

If approved, the new limit will come into effect on the first day of the month following approval.

How do I get my payments released sooner? 
In some cases, you can help to release your withheld payments more quickly.

By accessing your transactions and clicking on the payment received, you can have the option of checking whether the product or service provided has already been sent to the buyer, and this will help speed up the release.
`,
`
How do I add tracking information to my payment or update an order status?
To add tracking information or update an order status: 

Go to your Activity. 
Find the purchase you want to update and click Get your money. If you sold a product, choose “Product” to add tracking information or print a shipping label. If you sold an intangible item or service, choose “Service or virtual product” to update the order status. You can update the order status to Completed, Pending, or Canceled.  
Click Submit.
When you submit tracking information, your buyer will receive an email that includes the tracking number, order status, and shipping company.

To review your payment(s) on hold, log in to your account and click on Know your options under your PayPal balance.

Tax Holds | Backup withholding | PayPal US IRS (Internal Revenue Service)
What is Backup Withholding?
When you’re paid for goods and services, the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) considers this reportable income.

Once you reach the reporting threshold for goods and services payments within a calendar year, tax laws require us to withhold 24% of such payments when you have not confirmed your taxpayer status by either providing your US tax ID or completing a Certificate of Foreign Status. This 24% is sent to the IRS as backup withholding for any potential income tax due on those payments.

You can learn more about this tax law on the IRS website.



Please ensure you’ve updated your PayPal app to the latest version to view your tax hold(s) and confirm your taxpayer status.



What happens if I don’t confirm my taxpayer status?
To give you some time to confirm your taxpayer status, once you receive $600 in payments for goods and services, we’ll place your payments on a tax ID hold for at least 60 days until you confirm your taxpayer status by either providing your US tax ID or completing a Certificate of Foreign Status.

After this one-time (60-day) grace period, we’ll start sending 24% of your payments to the IRS as backup withholding for any potential income tax due on a monthly basis. The remainder of your funds will be released to your PayPal account balance.



Is backup withholding also due on the first $600 I receive?
If you fail to confirm your taxpayer status, 24% will be due on all payments you receive for goods and services, including those you received before reaching $600. Any amounts due to the IRS may be withheld from your available balance or future payments.



When will I get my payments?
You can confirm your taxpayer status by either adding your US tax ID or completing a Certificate of Foreign Status at any time to end the tax ID hold and backup withholding on your payments.

* Please note that it can take up to 30 minutes for the tax ID to update and trigger the removal of the tax ID hold from your account. Completing a Certificate of Foreign Status will require additional time.

Otherwise, we send backup withholding to the IRS on a monthly basis. That means payments that you receive will remain on a tax ID hold until the next scheduled backup withholding date. At such time,24% of your payments will be sent to the IRS and the rest will be released from the tax ID hold to the PayPal account balance (assuming no other holds apply).



Does this affect money I receive from friends or family?
Tax laws don’t affect money sent as a Friends and Family payment. They only apply to payments that you receive for goods and services. This includes payments you receive through Online Checkout or were sent by the Buyer as Goods and Services payments.



Can I get backup withholding returned?
We can’t return any amount sent to the IRS, but you can claim backup withholding when you file your taxes.

Adding your US tax ID or completing a Certificate of Foreign Status will help you avoid backup withholding when you’re paid.



What if I’m paid in a different currency?
This tax law applies when you reach the reporting threshold for goods and services payments, regardless of the currency in which you received the payment.

When payments you receive are put on a tax ID hold, currency conversion won’t occur until the tax ID hold is released.

Changes in the foreign exchange rate may result in a gain or loss between the time when the payment is received versus when the tax ID hold is released.

If you haven’t confirmed your taxpayer status by either providing your US tax ID or completing a Certificate of Foreign Status, we’re required to withhold 24% of your payments for any potential income tax due.

Your backup withholding payment will be sent to the IRS in US dollars each month. Any currency conversions to US dollars will be performed at the time tax holds are released and backup withholding is applied.



What if I don't have a tax liability to the US?
If you have received at least $600 USD in payments for goods and services in one calendar year and are not a US tax resident, completing a Certificate of Foreign Status will release your tax ID hold(s) and help you avoid backup withholding when you’re paid.

Note: Certificate of Foreign Status must be renewed every three years.

If you're unable to complete the certification process when prompted, or if you'd like to complete it proactively:

Non-US Customers with a Non-US PayPal Account:
Complete the Certificate of Foreign Status by filling out the CFS form for individuals or the CFS form for legal business entities.

Non-US Customers with a US PayPal Account:

Why is my money being held in reserve?
We may place a reserve on your business PayPal account to cover potential financial losses that may occur from chargebacks and disputes. This practice helps us to create a safer shopping experience.

When we place or review a reserve on an account, we consider several factors, such as: 

How long you’ve had your PayPal account
How long you’ve been in business
Your processing history with PayPal and other providers
Whether your industry has a higher likelihood of chargebacks or refunds
Whether your account has an elevated number of customer claims and disputes
Your business and/or personal credit history
Whether you’re selling products or services in advance (preselling orders)
Your delivery time frames
Reserves may be a necessity throughout your relationship with PayPal. Preventing reserves isn’t always possible, and depending on your industry and your credit history, you might never be able to fully remove a reserve from your account.

Some best practices to follow to reduce the likelihood of having a reserve are:

Ship promptly and give your customers valid tracking information through PayPal, so they know when to expect delivery.
Communicate early and often with your buyers and let them know about any changes, delays, or other important information.
Monitor your buyer complaint rates regularly and try to keep complaint rates below 1% of your sales.
Avoid long refund times, which can lead to complaints from unsatisfied customers.
We review reserves within 180 days of placement. Based on the improvements to your business performance, we can remove the reserve from your account or adjust the reserve amount.

`
Why is the money I sent on hold?
Sometimes, we may place a payment on hold for 24 hours as a security precaution. This can happen for many reasons, such as you haven't sent money in a while or you're sending money to someone new. 

We just need to confirm it's you sending the money. You don't need to do anything.

If there are no issues with the payment, it will complete within 24 hours. If we find that a payment wasn’t authorized, we reverse the transaction.
`,
`
Why do I have to confirm my identity to hold money in my PayPal balance?
We only ask you for essential information when you sign up to PayPal, but if you want to hold a balance, we're under a legal obligation to confirm your identity. Even though PayPal isn't a bank, we need to comply with the same government regulations as other financial institutions.

If we're unable to confirm your identity, you’ll only be able to send money and make PayPal purchases using your bank or debit/credit card, not your PayPal balance.
`,
`
What are reserves?
An account reserve is an amount of money set aside in your PayPal account to help make sure that you're able to meet any liabilities you may incur from a chargeback, claim or bank reversal, where no other money is available. The money is still yours, but you can’t use or withdraw it for now.

Usually, if you have a reserve on your account and receive a chargeback or dispute, we’ll deduct that amount from your available balance. However, if you go out of business or stop processing PayPal payments, we’ll use any reserve to cover future payment reversals.

There are 2 types of reserves we may place on your business PayPal account: rolling reserves and minimum reserves (one or combination of both at the same time).

A rolling reserve is a reserve where a percentage of each transaction you receive each day is held and then released later, on a scheduled basis. For example, your reserve could be set at 10% and held for a 90-day rolling period. It means 10% of the money you receive on day 1 is held and then released on day 91, 10% of the money you receive on day 2 is held until day 92, etc. Rolling reserves are the most common type of reserve.

A minimum reserve is a specific minimum amount of money that you’re required to keep available in the balance of your business PayPal account. We may hold money until it reaches a set amount, or hold it all at once—this is called an upfront reserve.

If your business improves, we may lower or remove your reserve.

Why is my cryptocurrency sale on hold? 
Why is my payment on hold or unavailable?
 Your crypto sale/crypto sale proceeds may be on hold due to the unique activity profile of your account. PayPal holds funds for a variety of reasons based on the activity of the account.

Check your account for specific reasons as to why we are holding your money and to learn how you can release it.

Is there a hold when I sell my cryptocurrency?  
If you buy cryptocurrencies but we have not yet received the cleared purchase funds from you, we are entitled to retain the proceeds of any sale by you of your cryptocurrencies pending our receipt of those cleared purchase funds.

We may place a temporary hold on these funds while they are pending (note the hold may not be released if we do not receive cleared purchase funds or if there is another issue with the payment or the account). As with all transactions, crypto sales are subject to review and could be delayed or stopped if there is an issue.

Why are the payments for the sale of cryptocurrency placed on hold?
Holds can be placed on a cryptocurrency sell transaction during a bank transfer (or where another issue with the payment or the account is identified). When the cryptocurrency sale is on hold during a bank transfer, the funds being transferred from your bank have not cleared in the original purchasing transaction. The temporary hold on the funds will be released upon the outstanding amount clearing.

Keep in mind that not all sell transactions will be put on hold. A hold may not be released if the payment transferred from your bank does not clear or if another issue with the payment or the account is identified.

How long will the sell transaction (payment) be on hold?
The hold time will vary depending on several risk factors, such as the amount waiting to be cleared from the bank transfer, and can generally take up to 8 days.

Will future transactions be held?
We cannot say with 100% certainty that no holds will be placed in the future, but if your account is in good standing then there is usually no reason for us to raise any concerns about your account.

Why is my withdrawal from PayPal on hold?
To provide a safe online payment service our internal security system reviews every transaction before it is released. Usually, withdrawals can take anywhere from 2-72 hrs to complete through our system. Generally, they'll complete within 2 hours; however, we occasionally hold a withdrawal, for further review. 

These reviews of withdrawals can happen for various reasons. For example, you may have received an amount of money that is larger than usual for your account, you may be logging in from an unsecured network or you may have made changes to your account Settings recently.

Once we have finished our review your withdrawal will show as ‘completed’ and will be processed to your bank account, providing that the review did not turn up any issues. Withdrawals to bank accounts can take up to 8 working days depending upon your bank's processing times.

How do I get a refund?
To request a refund for a completed payment, you’ll need to contact the seller.

To see the seller’s contact details:

Go to Activity.
Select the payment.
Use the contact information on this page to contact the seller.
If you receive a refund, the money will return to its original payment method, such as your bank, credit card, or PayPal account.

If you don't receive a refund, you can open a dispute in your Resolution Center. Make sure you file your dispute within the correct dispute-filing timeframe.

In a dispute, you can message the seller through PayPal to try to resolve any issues. If you cannot resolve the dispute, you have 20 days to escalate the dispute to a claim. In a claim, we investigate the case and decide the outcome.
`,
`
Where is my refund?
We send all refunds back to your original payment method. The time it takes to receive your money varies by payment method. In some cases, refunds go to your balance account in case we are unable to credit your original payment method or when you choose balance as the destination.

Within the Activity log, you will find the Refund Tracker. The Refund Tracker is a three-step tracker for your complete checkout transaction refunds funded by banks or cards (full-amount refunds that are not split between payment methods). The tracker consists of three steps, and each step has a specific meaning.

First Step:

Refund Initiated - PayPal has initiated the refund process.
Second Step:

Refund Processing - PayPal is processing the refund back to your original card or bank payment method.
Refund Sent - PayPal has completed the processing and has sent the refund ahead to your card issuer or bank. Note: that the refund has not yet been completed as your card issuer or bank may also take time to process the refund.
Third Step:

Refund Pending: The refund is now pending with your card issuer or bank for further processing if you have paid originally using a debit or credit card or bank.
Refund Completed: This is typically the last step of the refund journey. It means that you should have received the funds in your card or bank account. Note: If you have not received the refund yet, please reach out to your card issuer or bank to check the progress of the refund using the bank reference ID or by referring to the original transaction.
Refund Processing Timeframes

Credit card
The refund will be returned directly to your credit card. Depending on the card issuer, it can take up to 1 and 2 billing cycles* for the refund to appear on your credit card statement.

* A credit card billing cycle typically lasts 28 to 31 days. The number of days in each cycle can change, but it should be roughly one month.

We’ll still send a refund to a canceled or prepaid card. Contact your card issuing company to access this money. For checkout transactions, you may use the bank reference ID shown under Activity for tracking refunds with your card issuer.

Debit Card 
When you pay with your debit card, it will generally take up to 5 business days for your refund to be completed, however, depending on your card company, some refunds may take up to 30 days. For checkout transactions, you may use the bank reference ID shown under Activity for tracking refunds with your bank.

If we are unable to apply the refund to your debit card, we will add it to your PayPal balance.

Bank account
When you pay with your bank account, we’ll automatically transfer the refund to your bank account. Once issued, refunds usually take up to 5 business days to complete.

Some refunds may take up to thirty days, depending on the status of the payment at the time the refund was issued.

PayPal balance
When you pay with your balance, the refund will go to your PayPal Balance on the same day.

PayPal balance plus credit card
When you pay with your balance and credit card, the refund will go to your PayPal balance and credit card. Once issued, the refund will go to your balance on the same day. The refund to the card can take between 1-2 billing cycles*, depending on the card issuer.

* A credit card billing cycle typically lasts 28 to 31 days. The number of days in each cycle can change, but it should be roughly one month.

Some sellers can only send refunds with an eCheck issued by their bank. If you’re refunded by eCheck, it must clear the sender’s bank before you can receive it.

Once issued, an eCheck clearing process usually takes up to 5 business days to complete, but in some cases, it may take longer (Saturday, Sunday, and Holidays aren’t considered business days). The refund will appear in your balance with PayPal.

Here's how to view the status of a refund on the website:

Go to your Activity.
Click Filters and then select Refunds from the drop-down menu.
Select the desired date range to see your refund.
Click the refunded transaction to view the details.
Here's how to view the refund details on the app:

Tap Activity.

Common refund statuses
Pending
When your refund shows as "pending" it means the seller has issued the refund, but the money hasn’t cleared their bank. It usually takes up to 5 business days for a refund to complete. If your refund is still pending after 5 business days, contact the seller for details.

Temporary hold
When your refund shows as "on hold", the seller refunded before the original payment could clear your bank. It usually takes up to 5 business days for payments to clear your bank. When the original payment clears, the refund will complete.

Refunded or Partially Refunded
When your refund shows as "refunded or partially refunded", we’ve sent the money back to your original payment method.

Refunds involving a Currency Conversion

If your payment involved a currency conversion, your refund may differ from the original payment amount. This is due to fluctuations in currency conversion rates.

When a payment involves a currency conversion, we apply the conversion rate at that time. If a payment is refunded, we apply the rate at the time of the refund.

The conversion rate at the time of the refund may differ from the conversion rate on the original payment. For this reason, the refunded amount may not be the same as the original payment amount.

Completed
When your refund shows as "completed", the refund is complete, and we’ve returned the money to your original payment method.

Canceled
When your refund shows as "canceled", we’re unable to process the refund. Please contact the seller for more details.

`
How do I issue a refund in a dispute?
You can offer a partial or full refund. Issuing a full refund automatically closes a dispute. 

If a buyer accepts a partial refund offer, we close the dispute. If you offer a partial refund of less than the buyer requested, the buyer can accept or deny your offer.

Here's how to issue a refund:


Go to the Resolution Center.

Click the Case ID in the Case column.   
Click Issue Refund.
Enter either a full or a partial refund amount to resolve, and add a note if needed.

`,
`
How do I accept or deny a partial refund?

`
How does a merchant refund work for my Pay in 4 plan?
Since PayPal paid the merchant for your Pay in 4 purchase, we would attempt to apply the full or partial refund from the merchant to the corresponding Pay in 4 loan.

If the refund satisfies the entire outstanding balance on the Pay in 4 loan, you will not have any further repayment obligations. Please check your Pay in 4 loan details to ensure that the loan balance is marked as Completed. If the refund results in a credit balance refund (an overpayment of the Pay in 4 loan), your credit balance will be moved to your PayPal balance automatically. This can take up to 7 days if any of the repayments are still in process.

If your refund is partial, it will still be applied to your Pay in 4 loan. A partial refund may reduce the number of remaining payments or the amount of your final payment.

If the merchant issues a refund in the form of a store credit, gift card, or cash, your remaining loan balance will still be due to PayPal. This is because PayPal paid the merchant on your behalf when you were approved for a Pay in 4 loan and made your transaction with Pay in 4. Since the merchant refunded you directly, you’ll still owe any remaining balance on the loan.

Sometimes the merchant does not provide PayPal with enough information to identify a specific Pay in 4 plan where the refund should be applied. If this happens, PayPal will refund the amount we receive from the merchant to your linked PayPal balance account or PayPal account. This means that your Pay in 4 plan will not be credited with the refunded amount and will still be due. You are able to use the refunded funds from your PayPal balance account to pay your Pay in 4 plan directly through the PayPal app or website, or you can withdraw the funds to your bank account and then pay your outstanding Pay in 4 amount either though the website, app, or by Contacting Us.

`
How can I get a refund on a Google Pay purchase?
Each store has its own refund policies. With your printed receipt, the cashier will likely process a refund as they would for any other purchase. If you don't have a printed receipt, try tapping your phone on the payment reader, or give the cashier the last 4 digits of your virtual card number. It’ll often help them find the transaction in their system.

You can find your virtual account number by clicking on the PayPal card on the Google Pay home screen. Your refund will go to your PayPal balance.
`,
`
Should I still make Pay Monthly payments if I’m expecting a refund?
Yes. It’s important to keep your loan current and to continue making payments according to your payment schedule until the merchant processes the refund.

After the merchant processes your refund, we’ll apply the refunded amount to your Pay Monthly installment loan. If the refunded amount exceeds the outstanding balance on the loan, the excess money will be applied to your PayPal balance. We’ll notify you via email that the refund has been processed and applied to your Pay Monthly installment loan. If a credit balance refund is due to you, we’ll notify you via email when the refund is made.

How do I transfer my crypto?
PayPal supports the transfer of cryptocurrencies between PayPal, Venmo, and other wallets and exchanges. PYUSD can be transferred between PayPal and exchanges that support it. PYUSD can also be sent to most Ethereum and Arbitrum addresses in wallets that support ERC-20 tokens and most Solana addresses in wallets that support SPL tokens.

To send crypto outside of PayPal, you'll need to provide the wallet address where you want to send the crypto. Crypto transfers cannot be cancelled or reversed. Please ensure the recipient’s details are correct. Crypto that is sent to the wrong recipient, wrong address, or via unsupported networks will be lost. We aren’t able to reverse these transactions after they’re complete. For PayPal USD, first, check with your external wallet to confirm they will accept your PYUSD.

Here is how to transfer to an external BTC address or PayPal customer:

Go to the Finances tab.
Tap your crypto balance.
Tap the Transfer arrows Transfer arrows.
Tap Send.
If you want to sync your PayPal contacts so that you can send them crypto, tap Sync Your Contacts.
Tap OK to allow PayPal to access your contacts.
Select the contact you want to send crypto to.
You’ll need to enter an external crypto address if you want to transfer cryptocurrency out of your account.
Copy and paste an address, manually enter it, or scan a QR code by tapping the QR code button to the right of the search box.
If you are sending PYUSD to an external blockchain address, tap Got it on the blockchain network confirmation screen.
Enter the amount you want to send and tap Next.
You can put an exact amount of a cryptocurrency to send if you know it
Or you can enter a dollar amount. We’ll calculate approximately how much crypto is worth the amount you entered and send that amount of crypto. The dollar value of your sent crypto will change over time, so it could be worth more or less by the time the recipient gets it.
Review and tap Send Now.
Here is how to receive a cryptocurrency by sharing your PayPal destination address:

Go to the Finances tab.
Tap your crypto balance.
Tap the Transfer arrows Transfer arrows.
Tap Receive.
Choose which coin you want to receive, for example, BTC
Your QR code & Bitcoin address will appear.
If you choose to receive PYUSD, an Ethereum-compatible address will be generated by default.
Tap the Change button in the network selector to see the list of other blockchains that are compatible with PYUSD.
Tap the name of the other blockchain, for example, Solana to generate a compatible address for that blockchain.
You can either Copy or Email the address.
We’ll let you know by email when you receive crypto. You can always view the transfer status within your Activity.

Keep in mind:

Only cryptocurrency compatible with the generated address should be sent to this address. 
Each time you generate a cryptocurrency address, your address will change for privacy reasons. Each new address will be permanent and will be able to receive crypto.
What is the purchase price?
Purchase Price refers to the price you originally paid for your crypto, including fees. Entering a purchase price is optional- to show you more precise returns. If left blank, we’ll automatically use the price of the crypto at the time you receive it.

What is the Cash a Check service in the PayPal app?
The Cash a Check feature in the PayPal app (also referred to as remote check capture, mobile check cashing, or check reload) allows you to deposit checks on your mobile device and have them credited to your PayPal Balance account.

Take a picture of the check you want to cash and send it to us for review. Once your check is approved, you have the option to pay a fee and get your money credited to your PayPal Balance account, usually in minutes. If you don’t need the money immediately, you can get it in 10 days with no fee if the check is not returned unpaid. A PayPal Balance account is required to use the Cash a Check feature.

This feature is available to personal accounts and individual or sole proprietor accounts with PayPal Business Debit Mastercard®.

Here’s how to cash a check from your PayPal app:

Tap Accounts.
Tap Balance.
Tap Cash a check.
Enter the check amount, take a picture of the front and back of your endorsed check with your mobile device, and tap Next.
Select how quickly you want access to your money and tap Confirm.
It usually takes a few seconds to review a check for approval, although it can take 3-5 minutes and in rare circumstances, up to an hour to verify enough check information to approve your check.

If your check is approved, you’ll be prompted to write “VOID” across the front of your check and submit another photo showing it has been voided. Do not write “VOID” on your check until you are prompted to do so, after you receive confirmation that your check was approved.

Once finalized, you’ll see a confirmation page verifying the credit amount and when the money will be available in your PayPal Balance account.

The Cash a Check feature is not available to customers in the state of New York and it’s not available to customers who have a negative balance in their PayPal Balance account. Visit PayPal Balance Terms and Conditions for additional information. 

This Cash a Check service is provided by Ingo Money Inc, and there are applicable limits and fees, and terms. Please refer to Ingo Money Service - PayPal Terms and Conditions for details.

What is PayPal Add Cash at Stores and how do I use it?
You can add money to your PayPal Balance account at select retailers. All you need to do is swipe your PayPal-branded Debit Card or generate a barcode in your PayPal app and provide it along with the cash you want to add at the register.

Here's how to add cash in the PayPal app:

Tap PayPal balance from the Home tab or the Accounts tab.
Tap Add Cash at Stores on the PayPal balance page.
Select a retailer to generate a barcode. Wait until you're at the retail location to generate the barcode on your phone. Once you get the barcode on your mobile phone, it’ll expire after 1 hour. If it expires, you’ll need to create a new one.
Present the barcode on your smartphone to the cashier at your selected retail store and give the cashier the amount of cash you want to add.
The cashier will scan your barcode and add the money to your PayPal Balance account.
The cashier will give you a receipt and the money will be added to your balance within 15 minutes.

`,
`
Why is my withdrawal being held for review?
To provide a secure online payment service, our system automatically reviews every withdrawal before it's released. We may hold some withdrawals for up to 72 hours for further review. This review can happen for various reasons. For example, we may review the transfer if you’ve received an unusually large payment or if you’ve logged in from an unsecured network.

Why does my withdrawal need to be reviewed?
Withdrawals may be flagged for review due to a combination of factors. Some common reasons include:

Unusual account activity: Large or higher-than-normal payments preceding the withdrawal.
Untrusted networks: Logging in from unsecured or unfamiliar devices/networks.
Account status: Incomplete account verification or recent account limitations.
Withdrawal details: Discrepancies or errors in information provided when linking a bank account/debit card.
What to expect if your withdrawal is reviewed 
Holds and reviews typically last no more than 72 hours.
In some cases, reviews may resolve sooner if our system can process the withdrawal without manual intervention.
While your withdrawal is held for review:
Check your email: We'll notify you if any action is needed or if there's an update on your withdrawal.
Review your account: Ensure your payment methods (e.g., linked bank accounts, debit cards) are correctly entered and verified.
Verify activity: Check if recent transactions align with typical patterns on your account. If activity looks unusual, update your account details or contact us for assistance.
Once the review is complete, your withdrawal status will update to "Completed," and regular transfer timeframes will apply. Learn more about regular timeframes for withdrawals.
What happens if my withdrawal is declined?
In rare cases, a withdrawal may be declined rather than delayed. Learn about reasons for a declined withdrawal and what to do.

Fast Facts
How long will a withdrawal be held for review?
Most withdrawal reviews are resolved within 72 hours or sooner, but delays may occur depending on the situation.

Will PayPal notify me if my withdrawal is under review?
Yes, we'll email you if your withdrawal is held for review, detailing any next steps required.

How can I cancel my withdrawal?
Withdrawals can’t be canceled under any circumstances.

How do I transfer the money I’ve collected in a PayPal Fundraiser?
In your PayPal account, you’ll see a summary of the fundraiser’s total funds raised. You can transfer the money to your primary balance, and then withdraw it to a bank account linked to PayPal.

To transfer your PayPal Fundraiser balance:

Go to your Dashboard
Click Fundraisers
Choose the fundraiser you want to view
Click Transfer Money
Enter the amount to transfer, and click Transfer Money
Click Withdraw to Bank
Note that you're responsible to send money to the intended cause.

On October 7, 2024, PayPal disabled the ability to create Fundraisers as PayPal is discontinuing the PayPal Fundraisers program and services.

All current Fundraisers will remain open until they expire. You will need to move any funds from your existing Fundraisers into your PayPal balance no later than January 12, 2025. If you do not do so, we’ll move any remaining funds into your PayPal balance on January 13, 2025.

Customers can continue to support their favorite charities in the PayPal app. To get started, open the PayPal app, go to the menu, scroll down, and tap Donate under “Send and Pay” to find over one million charities vetted by PayPal.

When customers donate on the PayPal website or in the app, PayPal covers the transaction fees (when no currency conversion is involved), meaning 100% of their gift supports charity.
`,
`
Can I automatically transfer money to my PayPal Balance account?
Yes. You can set up automatic reloads to add a specified amount of money to your PayPal Balance account on a set schedule or whenever your balance falls below a threshold amount you select.

Scheduled Reloads

You can set up a recurring schedule to automatically transfer a specified amount from a selected linked bank account or linked bank debit card to your PayPal Balance account at regular intervals (weekly, every 2 weeks, or monthly).

Example: Add $25 from my bank debit card into my PayPal Balance account every 2 weeks.

Low Balance Reloads

You can select a minimum balance threshold for your PayPal Balance account and an amount to be transferred from a selected linked bank account or linked debit card to your PayPal Balance account when your balance falls below the selected minimum threshold.

Example: Add $50 from my bank debit card into my PayPal Balance account when my balance falls below $25.

Here’s how to set-up automatic reloads via the PayPal App:

Tap Accounts.
Select PayPal Balance.
Tap Set up auto reload.
Choose either 'Low Balance Reloads' or 'Scheduled Reloads' to set up your automatic transfers.



You can choose the reload amount, set the funding source, and specify the minimum threshold or frequency that will trigger the automatic reload. To change these selections at any time, tap Manage auto reload in the app.

What happens if I don't have sufficient money in my chosen payment method?

We’ll send an email notification to you. We won’t charge you for insufficient funds, but please check with your bank or card provider as charges may apply. We suggest reviewing your automatic reload settings to ensure successful processing for future attempts.

Note that there is a maximum of 2 pending low balance threshold automatic reloads per day. If your low balance threshold automatic transfer is triggered, and while that transfer is pending your balance drops further, PayPal will queue up another automatic reload request.

Are there any fees for using the auto reload feature?

No.
`,
`
Why was my payment declined?
If your payment is being declined, here are the most common reasons:

Your payment was declined by your bank or card issuer. To protect your privacy, your card issuer or bank doesn't tell PayPal why your card was declined. Contact your card issuer or bank for more information.
Your card details are outdated. Update the expiration date or billing address associated with your credit or debit card.
Your PayPal account is limited. Resolve a limitation placed on your account.
You need to go through a security check. To deliver a secure service, we may ask you to confirm your identity. We do this to make sure it's you using the PayPal account.
You haven’t confirmed the email address associated with PayPal. Confirm your email address now.
You haven’t confirmed your bank account. You need to confirm your bank account before you can use it to make payments.
You may be required to confirm your card. If a “Confirm Card” link appears next to your card details, you’ll need to confirm this debit or credit card before using it with PayPal. This step helps to make sure that the card is valid and belongs to you.
If none of the above apply or if you continue having issues with your payment:

Change your payment method. You can add a debit or credit card or add a bank account.
Confirm the recipient’s information. Make sure the recipient has finished registering for PayPal and you have their correct email address or phone number.
If your withdrawal is being declined, check PayPal error messages when trying to transfer money

`
What payment methods can I use with PayPal?

Your bank account
Your Visa, Mastercard, Discover, or American Express card
Your balance if you have a PayPal Balance account.

Before sending a payment, please ensure the payment method you want is the one selected. A payment method can’t be changed or canceled after a payment is sent, even if it shows it’s pending. If you sent a payment and want to change the payment method you’ll need to request a refund and send the payment again with the correct payment method.

You need to add a payment method (such as a card) to your PayPal account before you can select it as a preferred way to pay.

Setting a preferred payment method won’t affect automatic payments, like subscriptions or billing agreements. To set a preferred payment method for an automatic payment, go to your automatic payments and select the merchant in question.

`
What‘s the maximum amount I can send with my PayPal account?
Unverified account

If you don't have a verified PayPal account, you can send a one-time payment of up to $4,000.00 USD. There will be a limit on the total amount of money you can send. You’ll be able to view the sending limit when you go to send money.

Visit the PayPal User Agreement for additional information. 

Verified account

If you have a verified PayPal account, there's no sending limit on the total amount of money you can send. You can send up to $60,000.00 USD in a single transaction, but we may limit that amount to $10,000.00 USD. These amounts can also vary depending on your currency.
`,
`
Why was my payment sent as an eCheck and why is it pending?
Sometimes your bank-funded payment may be processed as an eCheck.

An eCheck is an electronic funds transfer from your bank account to another customer’s PayPal account. It usually takes between 4-7 business days to clear, but sometimes it may take longer (Saturday, Sunday, and Holidays aren’t considered business days).

To manage risk, PayPal may limit the payment methods available for a transaction. This can happen for a variety of reasons:

PayPal detects a payment attempt that’s unusual considering previous account history.
To ensure that there’s sufficient money in your bank account.
Any other reason we may find that indicates there’s possible risk associated with the payment.
We put security measures in place to review transactions before they’re sent out to protect all parties involved.

The payment may show as “pending” in your PayPal account. To view your payment status and the expected clearing date, visit your Activity and click on the transaction.

If there’s insufficient money in your bank account or your bank declines the transaction when we attempt to complete the eCheck payment, we’ll try again within 3 business days. If the payment is declined a second time, we’ll cancel it. Remember, your bank may charge a fee for declined payments.
`,
`
Why can I no longer send friends and family payments to Business accounts?
As of July 28, 2022, US Business accounts can no longer receive friends and family payments from US senders. This change was made for the following reasons:

To ensure that all eligible purchases are protected for both buyers and sellers by PayPal’s Purchase Protection, guarding against fraud and other things that can go wrong with purchases.
To help businesses properly track commercial income for reporting and tax compliance purposes.
To decrease buyer confusion between goods and services, and friends and family payment types.   
What’s the difference between friends and family payments and goods and services payments?

Goods and services payments are intended for commercial payments, for example, when you’re buying or selling art online, or paying your hairstylist. Eligible goods and services payments include Purchase Protection, which can protect the buyer and seller in case something goes wrong with a purchase, and includes a small fee paid by the seller. You should select this payment type when you’re paying a business, and if the person you’re paying has a Business account, it’ll be automatically selected.    

Friends and family payments are personal payments between two individuals for something like splitting a dinner bill. These payments can be made without fees for the sender and receiver.   

Can personal accounts still receive friends and family payments?

Yes, Personal accounts can still receive friends and family payments for personal purposes.  

Why should I use PayPal for peer-to-peer payments?

PayPal enables quick, easy, and secure payments between individuals and businesses almost anywhere in the world, whether you’re across the table or in another country. It’s easy to find and pay the party you need to pay with PayPal’s large, global footprint. You can trust your payment is safe with PayPal’s encrypted and secure technology, and because you don’t have to share your financial details when making payments. PayPal also provides more options for the money you receive. You can use your balance to shop online or in-store, invest, pay someone else, or you can transfer it quickly to your bank account.  

Plus, as a Business, PayPal provides eligible goods and services payments with Purchase Protection which guards you and your sellers in case something goes wrong with a purchase. In addition, PayPal allows you to collect payments quickly from your customers, and using their preferred method of payment: Credit or Debit Cards, Bank, or PayPal balance.  

What’s protected with Purchase Protection?

Purchase Protection protects buyers from losing money on purchases that don’t go as planned and covers these issues:

Item not received by buyer.
Item is received, but is significantly different than expected. 
Item is received, but is broken.
Item is received, but in different quantity than purchased.  
You can learn more about Purchase Protection here.  
`,
`
What email address should my customers use to send payments?
You can ask your customers to send their payment to any email address you’ve added to PayPal.
If your customer sends a payment to another email address, you can still get your money by adding that email address to PayPal. You can add up to 7 email addresses to your PayPal account.

When you make a payment in a foreign currency, we calculate the conversion rate for you. You'll see the rate when you make your payment.

When you make a payment using your card, you can choose to use your card issuer's conversion rate. If you choose to use your card issuer's rate, you won't know the conversion rate right away. To find out the exact rate, you'll need to check your card statement later or contact your card issuer directly.

To select your card issuer's rate, when reviewing your payment, select the option that says "Convert currency with PayPal" to change it to "Convert with card issuer."

If you don't see the option to choose your preferred conversion rate, it means that your card can only use either your card's conversion rate or PayPal's conversion rate.

You need to use an alternative payment method — If you only have one payment method linked to PayPal and it's declined, you can add another one (your debit or credit card or your bank account) and retry your payment.

You can update your Automatic Payments settings — Many of PayPal's largest fuel partners use PayPal Automatic Payments to speed up purchases. You can quickly change the way you pay and retry your payment.

The card linked to PayPal is expired or out of date — If the card you have on file doesn't have your current billing address or is expired, it will decline. You can update your card's expiration and/or your billing address quickly and easily in PayPal.

You don't have a funding source linked to PayPal — You can add your debit or credit card or your bank account to PayPal in just a few clicks.

You may need to add money to PayPal — If you're using a PayPal balance as a funding source and don't have enough money to cover the payment, add money to PayPal.

Your card issuer declined the card you wanted to use for this payment — Call them to identify the problem. To protect your privacy, your debit or credit card company or card issuer doesn't tell PayPal why your card declines. If you can still use your card, retry your payment.

If you continue to experience issues, contact us, and we'll do our best to assist you further.

Why was my bank account payment declined (we couldn’t confirm your bank account balance)?
Unlike credit or debit card payments, instant bank account payments aren’t immediately processed by your bank. Although PayPal processes these payments in real time, it might take 2-5 business days before the money is cleared. In other words, we couldn’t confirm that your available balance is enough to complete your payment.

Here’s what can happen if the bank account payment is returned:

Your bank may charge a fee.
Your backup payment method might be used instead.
Your PayPal balance could go negative.
What to do
Choose another way to pay. You can use a card or add money to your PayPal balance to complete the payment.
To manage your payment methods and select a preferred way to pay, go to Wallet.

Why was my bank account payment declined (the payment amount might be over your spending limit)?
As a safety measure, PayPal limits the number of payments and the total amount that can be sent before any pending bank account payments are cleared by your bank. This can often take 2-5 business days, so this temporary limit helps our customers avoid bank account payments from being returned.

Here’s what can happen if the bank account payment is returned:

Why was my bank account payment declined (the bank has returned your recent payments)?
A recent payment was returned by your bank. As a result, your PayPal balance may have become negative. We can only approve another bank account payment once this issue has been resolved.

Here are the most common reasons why your bank can return bank account payments:

You don’t have enough money to cover the payment amount.
The bank account has been closed.
Bank details are incorrect or do not match bank records.
What to do
Resolve your negative balance by logging in to your PayPal account and clicking the "Resolve Negative Balance" link. You can choose how to bring your balance to zero.
If a negative balance hasn’t appeared yet or the payment is declined again, choose another way to pay. You can use a card or add money to your PayPal balance to complete the payment.
Make sure your bank account is active, confirmed, and accepts payments. If you have already tried to confirm your bank, it might take 2-3 business days.
Before making a payment, ensure you have enough money in your bank account to cover it.

`
Why was my card payment declined (this payment method can’t be used at the moment)?
We're committed to making PayPal a safer place to buy and sell online. In order to keep your account secure, our security system may sometimes decline the usage of credit or debit cards. This might happen when we want to ensure the card belongs to you. When we decline a payment, we do it to protect our customers as best we can.

What to do
You may be required to confirm your card. If a “Confirm Card” link appears next to your card details, you’ll need to confirm this debit or credit card before using it with PayPal. If you have already tried to confirm your card, it might take 2-3 business days.

How do bank account payments work?
When you use your bank account as a payment option, the seller is usually credited immediately while our request for the money from your bank is processed.

To manage your backup payment methods on our website:   

Go to Settings. 
Click Payments. 
Under Online purchases, click Backup payment methods.   
If we’re not able to charge your backup payment method, your PayPal account balance may become negative.

I received an email from PayPal saying that my Direct Deposit routing number has changed. What does this mean?
To continue receiving Direct Deposit payments or to receive them in the future with PayPal, including for payroll or tax refunds, please promptly provide the updated routing number to your payer.

Where can I find my full updated Direct Deposit routing and account number?
To locate the Direct Deposit account and routing number you should use, please go to the Direct Deposit summary page.

I’m not currently using Direct Deposit with PayPal or don’t remember ever using it. Why did I receive an email saying my routing number changed?
Even if you’re not an active user of Direct Deposit, you may have used it in the past to receive payments from your payroll provider, or even federal or state tax refunds. If you currently aren’t receiving Direct Deposit payments with PayPal, no action is required at this time. We want to make sure you have your updated routing number for any future PayPal Direct Deposit payments.

What will happen if my Direct Deposit payments are processed after February 17, 2025, using my old routing number?
Direct Deposit payments processed after February 17, 2025, using your old routing number will be rejected and you will need to coordinate directly with your payroll provider or other payer to provide new payment instructions.

How will I know if my Direct Deposit with PayPal will continue uninterrupted after I've updated my routing number with my payer?
Direct Deposit payments processed after February 17, 2025, will be rejected if your old routing is used.

What is the PayPal Dispute Fee and why was I charged one?
PayPal charges a Merchant Dispute Fee to manage the dispute resolution process on transactions that were completed by a buyer with a PayPal account or a buyer using PayPal Checkout as a Guest. 

This Dispute Fee applies to such transactions both when the buyer files a claim directly with PayPal and when they file through a chargeback with their card issuer or a reversal with their bank. 

The Dispute Fee does not apply to transactions processed through PayPal Pro or Advanced credit and debit card processing, sometimes called "unbranded" transactions. 

The amount of the Dispute Fee depends on the percentage of claims filed against your total sales in the previous 3 months. The Standard Dispute Fee will apply unless your dispute rate is 1.5% or more and you had more than 100 sales transactions in the previous three full months. If you fall into that category, the High Volume Dispute Fee would apply for each dispute.  

The Standard Dispute Fee will be waived for Inquiries in the PayPal Resolution Center that aren't escalated to a claim, those that are resolved amicably between the buyer and the seller, or those filed to PayPal directly as an Unauthorized transaction.
`,
`
What is the inactivity fee?
Inactivity fees are not charged for PayPal account holders in the US. The inactivity service fee applies only in certain countries in the European Union and Canada.    
`,
`
Do I get charged a cash advance fee when using my debit or credit card to make a payment?
No. When you use your debit or credit card, you won’t be charged a cash advance fee for sending money for goods or services. For those payments made as gifts or to friends and family, there’s a fee that the sender can either pay or opt to have the receiver pay.

For these types of payments, PayPal charges your debit or credit card only for the payment amount.

Tip: If you make a cash advance purchase with a credit or debit card, the card issuer may charge a cash advance fee. PayPal has no control over third-party fees. To avoid incurring fees when making a cash advance purchase, you may want to use a different payment method, such as your bank account or an eCheck (if available).
`,
`
Are there fees for Seller Profiles?
Seller Profile doesn't have a fee, but you'll pay the standard fee for each Goods and Services transaction. For additional information on fees, refer to our site for more information.

What are the advantages of using a Seller Profile over a Personal Profile?
As a small business owner, you want to do everything you can to protect your business. By using a Seller Profile, you’re eligible for Seller Protection. You can also link your social media channels to your Seller Profile.

Can the buyers pay the fees?
No. We always charge Seller Profile transactions to the seller. For additional information on fees, refer to our site for more information.

What are Goods and Services transactions?

Goods - payment type when you're paying for an item/product.
Services - payment type when your purchase isn’t a product but a service (for example, work performed for you by someone else).
Can I get a refund for the fee?
No. We don’t include the Goods and Services fee when you issue a payment refund.

When will I start being charged fees?
The fee will be a part of Seller Profile transactions from the start. For additional information on fees, refer to our site for more information.

`
What are the cross-border fees when selling internationally?
International personal payments and purchase payments are subject to cross-border fees. They’re paid by either the sender or recipient of the payment, not both. The sender of the payment generally determines who pays the fee. Cross border fees apply because multicurrency payments involve additional costs.

International Personal Payments: 

If you send or receive an international personal payment using your PayPal balance or bank account, you’ll pay a cross-border fee. Fees can vary depending on your location. Please visit our Fees page for more information. 
If you use a credit or debit card to pay for international personal payments fully or partially, you’ll pay a cross-border fee. Fees can vary depending on your location. Please visit our Fees page for more information. 
International Purchase Payments: 

If you receive an international payment for a purchase, you’re charged a standard fee, plus an additional fixed fee. The fixed fee is based on the currency of the payment. Please visit our Fees page for more information. 
It’s free to send payments for your purchases, even for some international payments. Some fees may apply if PayPal performs a currency conversion to complete your payment. Your financial institution may charge fees directly to the card you use to fund a cross-border payment even where no currency conversion is involved.
For more information about fees, click Fees at the bottom of any PayPal page.
`,
`
How is the dispute rate calculated and how do I avoid being charged a dispute fee?
The dispute rate for a seller is determined when the dispute is created. It’s based on the ratio of the total transaction amount of all Item Not Received and Significantly Not as Described claims that a seller receives compared to the total amount of their sales for the previous 3 calendar months.

A merchant’s total claims include all Item Not Received and Significantly Not as Described claims that are filed either directly with and escalated to PayPal or with the buyer’s card issuer or bank. Total claims don’t include claims for unauthorized transactions.

A merchant’s dispute rate can change between the Standard rate and the High Volume rate over time. For any given transaction dispute, the applicable dispute fee will be based on the seller’s dispute rate when the case is created.

What is defined as a High Volume Dispute Fee & a Standard Dispute Fee?
If a seller had more than 100 sales transactions in the previous three full months and their dispute rate over that time was 1.5% or more, they will be charged the High Volume Dispute Fee for each dispute. Otherwise, the Standard Dispute Fee will be applicable for each dispute.  

How can sellers in the Standard Dispute Fee scenario avoid being charged the fee for a dispute? 
Sellers won’t be charged a Standard Dispute Fee for disputes that are:    

Inquiries in PayPal’s Resolution Center that are not escalated to a claim with PayPal. 
Resolved directly between seller and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.
Filed by the buyer directly with PayPal as an Unauthorized Transaction. 
Eligible for PayPal’s Seller Protection program.
Claims with a transaction value that is less than twice the amount of the Standard Dispute fee.    
Decided in seller’s favor by PayPal or by the issuer.  
How can sellers in the High Volume Dispute Fee scenario avoid being charged the fee for a dispute? 
Sellers won’t be charged a High Volume Dispute fee for disputes that are:    

Inquiries in PayPal’s Resolution Center and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.    
Resolved directly between seller and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with PayPal..    
Filed by the buyer directly with PayPal as an Unauthorized Transaction. 
How will High Volume Dispute Fee merchants be treated differently than other merchants?
High Volume Dispute Fee merchants will be charged a higher fee for disputes filed by their customers, compared to Standard dispute rate merchants in their market. Merchants in this tier won’t be able to take advantage of certain exclusions and will be charged a Dispute Fee for all claims and chargebacks which are not amicably resolved, regardless of the dispute outcome.  

How will PayPal notify merchants of their dispute rate?
PayPal will notify merchants of their Dispute rate periodically. This may include emails to the merchants’ account email address, merchant reports, and in the Resolution center.  

Where can I see the dispute rate for my PayPal account?
You will find your Dispute Rate & Dispute Fee Tier in the Resolution Center.   

Where can I see the fee amount charged to my account and my case?
Go to the dispute details on your Case Summary Page to see if you were charged the Dispute Fee.   

Will High Dispute Fee merchants be provided any notice prior to the implementation of the Dispute Fee?
Merchants who would fall into the High Dispute Fee tier will be given a 90-day grace period after User Agreement changes related to the Dispute Fee become effective for their region. They can use this time to bring down their dispute rate to avoid being charged higher fees associated with their claims.  

Will fees be reimbursed if the merchant appeals and wins a case?
Yes, if a merchant appeals and wins the case, both the disputed amount and the Standard Dispute Fee may be reimbursed. 

The High Volume Dispute Fee, if applicable, will not be reimbursed because it does not depend on the case outcome.  

Does the Dispute Fee impact Chargeback fees on unbranded (DCC) PayPal transactions?
Disputes on unbranded transactions will not be charged a Dispute Fee, but will continue to be charged the Chargeback fee, according to the existing Chargeback fee policies and Seller Protection eligibility.

Crypto on PayPal: Fees and Exchange Rates
Are there any fees using Crypto with PayPal?
When you buy or sell cryptocurrency on PayPal, we'll disclose an exchange rate and the transaction fee you'll be charged for that transaction.

For PayPal USD only, there are no fees to buy or sell. However, fees apply when you convert between PYUSD and one of the other cryptocurrencies we support.

If you use a linked bank account or debit card as a payment method to buy crypto assets, your bank may charge you its own fees, including overdraft or insufficient fund fees where applicable. PayPal isn’t responsible for any fees that may be charged to you by your bank.

Why is there an exchange rate for cryptocurrency?
Since crypto is digital money, you're essentially swapping one currency for another when you buy and sell it. The exchange rate tells you how much crypto or other currency you'll get in the swap. Please keep in mind that exchange rates refresh often as the value of crypto is constantly changing. 
`,
`
Are there any fees charged for using PayPal Giving Fund?
PayPal Giving Fund doesn’t charge charities or donors any fees. In some cases, our partners may charge fees on donations made through their platforms, which they disclose on their websites. PayPal payment processing fees are applied to donations made on some partners’ platforms.

PayPal covers 100% of the payment transaction fees for donations made to benefit charities on PayPal’s app and website.  However, please note that currency conversion fees will apply when converting currencies.

Please visit our website if you'd like to learn more about PayPal Giving Fund and our policies. If you aren't a PayPal customer and have questions about PayPal Giving Fund, please contact us.

`
Does PayPal charge any fees to create and run a PayPal Fundraiser?
On October 7, 2024, PayPal disabled the ability to create Fundraisers as PayPal is discontinuing the PayPal Fundraisers program and services.

All current Fundraisers will remain open until they expire. You will need to move any funds from your existing Fundraisers into your PayPal balance no later than January 12, 2025. If you do not do so, we’ll move any remaining funds into your PayPal balance on January 13, 2025.

Customers can continue to support their favorite charities in the PayPal app. To get started, open the PayPal app, go to the menu, scroll down, and tap Donate under “Send and Pay” to find over one million charities vetted by PayPal.

With PayPal Fundraisers, if you’re raising money for a charity, PayPal covers the transaction fees, so 100% of the donation goes to the charity (when no currency conversion is involved).

If you raise money for yourself, someone else, or a group, you can choose to make it a listed fundraiser or an unlisted fundraiser.

If you choose to make it a listed fundraiser, where it's discoverable and promoted via the PayPal app and website, you’ll pay a fee for every payment received in your listed fundraiser.
If you choose to unlist the fundraiser and share it only with selected people, there’s no fee for you to pay. The donors may need to pay a standard personal transaction fee, depending on the payment method they use and the country/ region where their PayPal account is registered. They can see the fee amount when completing the donation.

`
Are there any fees for using Pay Monthly?
No, however, late or missed payments may be reported to the credit bureaus and you may be charged a returned payment, NSF, or other fee by your financial institution if the payment fails.

Follow the instructions to confirm your identity and enter your Direct Deposit information.
After enrollment, here’s how to find your Direct Deposit Account and Routing numbers:

Click or tap Direct Deposit.
Take note of your account and routing number.
You can copy them in the app or on the web.

Your Payer may also ask you to fill out their own direct deposit form.
Once you enroll in Direct Deposit, your Payer’s bank may try to verify your account using micro entries before initiating a deposit for security reasons. You may see two small credits, typically less than $1, and one offsetting debit entry denoted with an ACCTVERIFY description in your PayPal Balance account transaction history. You may be asked to manually enter these amounts on the Payer’s website.
`,
`
How long does it take to see money from Direct Deposit in my PayPal Balance account?
Funds deposited via Direct Deposit are automatic once set-up. The actual timeframe for the money to hit your PayPal Balance account depends on a few factors.

It can take up to 2 pay cycles for Direct Deposit payments from employers or payroll providers to begin. This is primarily because there’s a cutoff before which your employer or payroll provider would need to select your account information to verify and arrange Direct Deposit.

The cutoff (including what type of payroll software your employer or payroll provider uses and when payroll is submitted) and when Direct Deposit was set up (date and time of day), will impact when your account can receive money via Direct Deposit. This may mean you’ll continue to receive physical checks for a little while longer until everything is set up.

Once Direct Deposit is set up:

Money transferred via Direct Deposit is generally available on the day that the funds are applied to your account. It can be 2 days in advance or the same day, depending on the type of funds coming in. We don’t receive money via Direct Deposit instantly; there’s some delay between the payment being initiated by the Payer and it arriving to PayPal. For example, Direct Deposit of money may be delayed for a few days in the event of a federal or bank holiday.

For customers who are eligible to receive Direct Deposit 2-Day Early Access, access to the money depends on when we get payment instructions from your Payer (your employer, government agency, or payroll provider). When we get instructions before the scheduled payment date, your money can be made available up to 2 days sooner. Availability and timing vary based on the Payer.

For customers who don’t currently have Direct Deposit 2-Day Early Access, you should receive your money no later than 8pm EST on your payment day. If you haven’t received your money, please contact the Payer to check that the account and routing number details are correct. Once confirmed, you can contact us to investigate further.

If you don’t currently have Direct Deposit 2-Day Early Access, we’re working to enable its capability in the coming months.

`
How do I set up Direct Deposit with my PayPal Debit Card?

`
What is Direct Deposit?
Direct Deposit enables you to receive a portion or all of your paycheck or government payment automatically into your PayPal balance.

Direct Deposit is commonly used to transfer an employee’s salary. However, it may also be used for federal or state government benefits or payments, like Social Security payments, unemployment, tax refunds, the Child Tax Credit, or stimulus checks.

If you enroll in Direct Deposit with PayPal, money lands in your PayPal Balance account. This avoids the need for physical deposits either by standing in line at a bank or by depositing a physical check. You, as the Payee, can automatically deposit all or a portion of your paycheck, government benefit or payment, or other payments into your PayPal Balance account.

Once you enroll in Direct Deposit, your Payer’s bank may try to verify your account using micro entries before initiating a deposit for security reasons. You may see two small credits, typically less than $1, and one offsetting debit entry denoted with an ACCTVERIFY description in your PayPal Balance account transaction history. You may be asked to manually enter these amounts on the Payer’s website.

Here’s how to access your transaction history:

Go to your Activity.
Select or search for your payment. You can also click Filters to narrow your search by status or transaction type.
Some of the primary benefits of Direct Deposit include:

Once set up, money moves seamlessly from Payer to you, the Payee.
There are no limits, no fees, and it’s free to set up with PayPal.
It’s economical for employers and eco-friendly by avoiding printing physical checks.
`,
`
How does Direct Deposit work?
The Payer (employer, government agency, or payroll provider) requires the Payee's bank account information (account and routing number, bank name) or a voided check to make a Direct Deposit into the Payee's account.

If you enroll in Direct Deposit, your Payer’s bank may try to verify your account using micro entries before initiating a deposit for security reasons. You may see two small credits, typically less than $1, and one offsetting debit entry denoted with an ACCTVERIFY description in your PayPal Balance account transaction history. You may be asked to manually enter these amounts on the Payer’s website.

Here’s how to access your transaction history:

Go to your Activity.
Select or search for your payment. You can also click Filters to narrow your search by status or transaction type.
Once Direct Deposit is established, the Payer issues an electronic payment to the Payee that is automatically transferred into the Payee's PayPal Balance account. The network used is called the Automated Clearing House (ACH). The ACH organizes the payment instructions and makes sure that payments are made to the correct banks and accounts. Unlike other deposits, there’s no need to wait for the money to clear.

Typically, up to 5 business days prior, the Payer (employer, government agency, or payroll provider) sends its payment instructions to its financial institution, which passes that information to the ACH. The ACH sorts the entries and ensures that each instruction is routed to the correct bank account for each payment. Then, the ACH transfers your payment to your bank, and your bank releases the money into your PayPal Balance account.

`
I received an email from PayPal saying that my Direct Deposit routing number has changed. What does this mean?
To continue receiving Direct Deposit payments or to receive them in the future with PayPal, including for payroll or tax refunds, please promptly provide the updated routing number to your payer.

Where can I find my full updated Direct Deposit routing and account number?
To locate the Direct Deposit account and routing number you should use, please go to the Direct Deposit summary page.

I’m not currently using Direct Deposit with PayPal or don’t remember ever using it. Why did I receive an email saying my routing number changed?
Even if you’re not an active user of Direct Deposit, you may have used it in the past to receive payments from your payroll provider, or even federal or state tax refunds. If you currently aren’t receiving Direct Deposit payments with PayPal, no action is required at this time. We want to make sure you have your updated routing number for any future PayPal Direct Deposit payments.

What will happen if my Direct Deposit payments are processed after February 17, 2025, using my old routing number?
Direct Deposit payments processed after February 17, 2025, using your old routing number will be rejected and you will need to coordinate directly with your payroll provider or other payer to provide new payment instructions.

How will I know if my Direct Deposit with PayPal will continue uninterrupted after I've updated my routing number with my payer?
Direct Deposit payments processed after February 17, 2025, will be rejected if your old routing is used. Please confirm with your payroll provider or other payer that the change to process payments using the updated routing number will take effect before February 17, 2025. This is important because it may take up to 2 pay cycles for your payment instructions to be processed by your payroll provider or other payer.

Did my account number change?
No, the account number stayed the same.
`,
`
What are the advantages of Direct Deposit?
Easier and faster access to money
With the Direct Deposit option available, transactions become easier and faster. Direct Deposit minimizes the number of bank visits for both the Payer and the Payee. Money transferred is usually available immediately or made available on payday depending on the type of fund that is deposited. Direct Deposits are a more convenient and safer method of transferring money, as they eliminate the possibility of theft or loss of a check or cash since the deposit is carried out electronically. The use of Direct Deposit also minimizes check fraud.

More efficient payroll process with Direct Deposit
For businesses, the use of Direct Deposit eases the payroll process, as it allows for the timely payment of salaries and/or wages, and it reduces the bookkeeping workload since no delays of cash movements occur, and money is paid directly to the employee’s bank account.

Set up and forget
Once Direct Deposit is set-up successfully and you start seeing money coming through, you don’t have to worry about setting it up again.

No fee to receive funds
There’s no minimum balance maintenance or fee when you set up Direct Deposit at PayPal. Some banks charge monthly fees on checking accounts, but they commonly waive the fee if you maintain a sufficient balance or receive a Direct Deposit each month.

How do I cancel Direct Deposit?
To cancel Direct Deposit, notify your Payer (employer, government agency or payroll provider) of the change. It can take up to 2 pay cycles for Direct Deposit to stop once your employer or payroll provider has received and processed your notification. If you set up your Direct Deposit automatically through PayPal, you’ll still need to notify your Payer of the change.

`
Is there a minimum amount I need to add when using Direct Deposit?
There are no limits, no fees, and it’s free to set up. However, your Payer (your employer, government agency or payroll provider) may have specific guidelines on dollar amounts that you may need to follow.
`,
`
What government benefits or payments can I receive in my PayPal Balance account using Direct Deposit?
Government benefits or payments are typically made immediately to a Payee when enrolled in Direct Deposit. Wondering if you’re eligible to receive your money this way? As a US citizen, you’re likely to be eligible for Direct Deposit if you have government benefits or payments due to you and if you have an open and active bank account with a financial institution. This includes a financial institution that is linked to your PayPal Balance account.

Since federal law requires that certain government benefits or payments, such as Social Security payments, be made electronically, Direct Deposit is the fastest and most secure option for receiving your money. Most unemployment programs also allow unemployment funds to be transmitted electronically, including via Direct Deposit.

In addition, taxpayers have the option to receive their tax refunds from either a physical check or using Direct Deposit. Individuals with children eligible for the monthly Child Tax Credit for 2021 can also take advantage of Direct Deposit.

To set up Direct Deposit:

Click the Settings icon.
Click View your Direct Deposit info.

`
Who should I contact when getting an error when trying to set up Direct Deposit?
There are a few possible reasons why you may run into an error when setting up Direct Deposit automatically.

We recommend that you start by contacting your Payer so you can:

Troubleshoot possible incorrect credentials or reset your password
Ask your Payer for permission to make an automated switch to your Direct Deposit
Complete setting up your account with the Payer if it isn’t already
Unlock your account for too many failed login attempts
Confirm how often you can switch the Direct Deposit account or change the percentage allocation
If you came across a connection error or session timeout, please refresh your browser/app and try again.

To get help finding the exact reason for getting an error, please contact us.
`,
`
What if I’m having trouble confirming my credentials to link Direct Deposit automatically?
Once you find who pays you, look for an option to get help logging in. If this option isn’t available to you or you have trouble recovering your information, you can still copy your Direct Deposit account and routing number to provide to your Payer for Direct Deposit set up.
`,
`
Can I specify a certain percentage or dollar amount to be added to my PayPal balance when setting up Direct Deposit automatically?
Usually when setting up your Direct Deposit automatically with PayPal, we’ll ask you to specify how much of your paycheck or government benefit or payment you’d like to be deposited. Some Payers don’t allow a partial Direct Deposit.
`,
`
What is Direct Debit?
Direct Debit is a simple and convenient way to make one-time or recurring payments using your PayPal balance using your PayPal balance. Direct Debit authorizes a merchant (or service provider) to initiate payments from your PayPal Balance account for things like utilities, subscriptions, or memberships.

These Direct Debit payments are set up and authorized on a third-party merchant's website or mobile application. Direct Debit payments occur over the ACH network using your assigned Bancorp account and routing number. You may be provided with a Bancorp account and routing number when you open a PayPal Balance account, enroll in Direct Deposit, or open and PayPal Debit Card. To use Direct Debit, provide your Bancorp routing and account number when prompted for a bank account as you are setting up a payment with a merchant.

Here's how to find your routing and account number:

Log in to your PayPal account.
Click Direct Deposit in your profile.
There you will find your routing and account number.
You can manage Direct Debit preferences anytime by going to Direct Debit settings using the same steps above.

Direct Debit may be toggled “on” by default, which will allow payments to go through. If you disable Direct Debit payments by turning the toggle “off,” all initiated or scheduled Direct Debit payments, and any other payment or withdrawal transaction made with your account and routing number initiated on a third-party platform, will not go through. Disabling Direct Debit payments will not affect your ability to receive funds via Direct Deposit.

If you wish to cancel a Direct Debit payment, you can contact the merchant or PayPal Customer Service at least three business days in advance to enable a stop payment.

For more information, refer to the "Withdrawing Money from a Balance Account" section in the PayPal Balance Terms and Conditions. 

Direct Debit payment limits are as follows:

Maximum per transaction limit: $7,000
Maximum daily limit on aggregate amount of all transactions: $7,000
Maximum daily limit of 10 transactions per day
Direct Debit payments are not eligible for the PayPal Purchase Protection Program
Third-party merchants or service providers may refer to Direct Debit payment transactions as ACH Debit or E-Check.

What's the difference between a dispute and a claim?
A buyer can open an Item Not Received (INR) or Significantly Not as Described (SNAD) dispute in their Resolution Center if their order doesn't arrive or isn’t as described.

In a dispute, the buyer and seller have 20 days to exchange messages in the Resolution Center to try to solve the problem. For example, the buyer can ask for a refund, ask the seller to resend the item or arrange a return. In a dispute, PayPal doesn’t get involved or decide the outcome.

To ask PayPal to investigate the case and decide the outcome, the dispute must be escalated to a claim within 20 days. Either the buyer or seller can escalate a dispute to a claim.

The time it takes us to decide the outcome of a claim can vary. It depends on whether we need more information or not, and how quickly both parties respond to our inquiries. We usually reach a decision within 14 days, but some cases can take 30 days or longer.
`,
`
What is a chargeback, and why did I get one?
When a customer files a chargeback with their credit card issuer, it means that they’re disputing a charge and asking the card issuer for a refund.

A customer might file a chargeback because they:

Didn’t receive their item.
Received a damaged or defective item.
Don’t recognize a credit card charge.
Were charged more than once for something
Didn’t authorize a payment.
If you receive a chargeback, we’ll let you know. If you don’t agree that the chargeback is valid, you can help us dispute it by providing information about the transaction in the Resolution Center. It typically takes 30 days for us to dispute the chargeback, and it may take your buyer's card company up to 75 days to resolve a chargeback and come to a final decision.



Here is how to resolve a chargeback complaint:

1. Go to the Resolution Center.
2. Click Respond under “Action” next to your case.
3. Read the status details of the complaint and click Resolve Chargeback Now.
4. Choose one of the below options listed to resolve the chargeback:

Provide valid tracking information in order to dispute the chargeback received.
Provide valid proof of a refund (either within or outside of PayPal) in order to dispute the chargeback.
Accept liability for the chargeback.
5. Provide evidence for dispute (other than tracking information).
6. Click Continue and follow the instructions provided.



A chargeback isn’t the same as a PayPal claim. The chargeback process is initiated outside of PayPal, between the card issuer and their cardholder. In a dispute over a chargeback, the decision is ultimately made by the card issuer and we don't decide the outcome.

PayPal charges a fee (based on the currency received) to the seller when the buyer files a chargeback with his/her credit card issuer.

If the transaction is protected by Seller Protection Policy, PayPal will cover the amount of the chargeback and waive the chargeback fee. You can view the chargeback fee and process in our User Agreement

`
How do I close my dispute or claim?
Make sure that you’re 100% satisfied with how the case was resolved before closing it. If the seller offered to refund your money, for example, make sure that the money is in your PayPal account before you close the case.

Once a case is closed, it can’t be reopened or escalated to a claim.

Here's how to close a case:  

Go to your Resolution Center. (The Resolution Center is only accessible on a web browser, not the PayPal app.)
Click View next to the dispute you want to close.
Click Close this dispute.
Let the seller know why you're closing the dispute, then click Close dispute.
`,
`How do I upload a document for a claim?
To help us settle a claim, you may be required to upload a document such as proof of shipment or delivery for an item, supporting information on its authenticity, etc.

You will get updates on what kind of documents to upload in your Resolution Center and via email.

Here's how to upload a document:

Go to your Resolution Center.  
Click Respond beside your claim. 
Click Respond. 
Choose I'd like to submit the requested info. 
Drag and drop the file, include a short description and click Submit.
`,
`
How do I issue a refund in a dispute?
You can offer a partial or full refund. Issuing a full refund automatically closes a dispute. 

If a buyer accepts a partial refund offer, we close the dispute. If you offer a partial refund of less than the buyer requested, the buyer can accept or deny your offer.

Here's how to issue a refund:


Go to the Resolution Center.   
Select Open Cases and find the transaction.   
Click the Case ID in the Case column.   
Click Issue Refund.
Enter either a full or a partial refund amount to resolve, and add a note if needed.
Click Issue Refund.
If you refund a payment for goods or services, there are no fees to issue the refund, but the payment receiving fees aren’t returned.  

If your PayPal account doesn’t have enough money, we’ll request it from your primary bank account. In this case, it usually takes up to 5 business days for the refund to complete.
`,
`
How long does it take to resolve a dispute or claim?
In a Purchase Protection (Item Not Received or Significantly Not as Described) dispute, you can exchange messages with the other party in your Resolution Center to try to solve the problem.

If you’re unable to settle the dispute, you can escalate it to a claim. To escalate a dispute, we often require that at least 7 days have passed since the payment date.

By escalating a dispute to a claim, you’re asking PayPal to investigate and decide the outcome. A dispute will automatically close after 20 days unless it’s been escalated. Closed disputes cannot be reopened or escalated to a claim.

The time it takes us to decide the outcome can vary. It depends on how quickly both parties respond to our enquiries and whether or not we need more information.

We usually reach a decision within 14 days, but some cases can take 30 days or longer.

Keep an eye on your emails and your Resolution Center for updates from us, or requests for more information.
`,
`
What is the PayPal Dispute Fee and why was I charged one?
PayPal charges a Merchant Dispute Fee to manage the dispute resolution process on transactions that were completed by a buyer with a PayPal account or a buyer using PayPal Checkout as a Guest. 

This Dispute Fee applies to such transactions both when the buyer files a claim directly with PayPal and when they file through a chargeback with their card issuer or a reversal with their bank. 

The Dispute Fee does not apply to transactions processed through PayPal Pro or Advanced credit and debit card processing, sometimes called "unbranded" transactions. 

The amount of the Dispute Fee depends on the percentage of claims filed against your total sales in the previous 3 months. The Standard Dispute Fee will apply unless your dispute rate is 1.5% or more and you had more than 100 sales transactions in the previous three full months. If you fall into that category, the High Volume Dispute Fee would apply for each dispute.  

The Standard Dispute Fee will be waived for Inquiries in the PayPal Resolution Center that aren't escalated to a claim, those that are resolved amicably between the buyer and the seller, or those filed to PayPal directly as an Unauthorized transaction.
`,
`
How can I appeal PayPal’s decision on my case?
The decision at the end of a claim is typically final and can only be appealed if new information is provided.

Appeals are generally denied for the following reasons:

Either party is dissatisfied with the decision, but does not provide new information.
Either party requests an explanation for why the claim was denied.
The seller disagrees with the decision to allow a return or not to require one.
An item verified as inauthentic is returned in a damaged condition.
The seller reports the same damage or issue upon return that the buyer initially claimed.
Either party fails to respond to requests within the given timeframe.
The claim has already been appealed twice, and the appeal decision does not contain new information or errors.
If you are a buyer and need to discuss options for appealing a claim's outcome, you should contact customer support.





Sellers or merchants who wish to appeal a claim can do so in the Resolution Center within 10 days of the case closing.

Here’s how to appeal the decision of a case:
Go to the Resolution Center.
Click Report a Problem.    
Select Closed cases in the drop-down menu and find the claim you want to appeal.    
Click Appeal in the action column.  
The Appeal button will only be available for 10 days after your case closes.
`,
`
How do I report a billing issue?
If you identify a billing issue with a transaction on your account, we encourage you to report it in our Resolution Center as soon as possible. By opening a dispute, you're notifying the seller that you're not satisfied with the purchase and want to resolve the issue.

When there are multiple charges for the same transaction on your credit or debit card, it may be because you inadvertently clicked Send Money more than once. To get your money back, you’ll need to contact the recipient and request a refund.

To see the seller’s contact details:

Go to Activity.
Select the payment.
Use the contact information on this page to contact the seller.
`,
`
Can I change my reason for filing a dispute or claim?
You can change your reason if you originally filed a dispute because you didn't receive your item, and then received the item but found it to be different from the description.

Here's how to change your reason for a dispute:

Go to your Resolution Center. (The Resolution Center is accessible under 'Help' via the PayPal app.)
Click View next to your case. 
Click Change your reason for this dispute/claim.
By changing the dispute reason, you automatically escalate the dispute to a claim.

This means that you're asking PayPal to review your case and decide the outcome.  

We usually reach a decision on Item Not Received (INR) or Significantly Not as Described (SNAD) claims within 14 days, but some cases can take 30 days or longer. Keep an eye on your emails and your Resolution Center for updates from us, or requests for more information. 

If a non-receipt claim you filed was closed and you received your item, you can appeal it and change the claim reason to Item Not As Described.
`,
`
How do I prove that I've sent an item to the buyer?
If a buyer claims they didn’t receive an item, you may be required to provide proof of shipment.

Online or physical documentation from a shipping company should include the recipient's name and address, as shown on the Transaction Details page. We’ll ask you to upload this to the Resolution Center.

For transactions above $750 USD (or the equivalent amounts in different currencies), we also require signature confirmation.

If the buyer demands that you deliver to an address different from the one in the Transaction Details page, we suggest contacting the buyer to arrange a refund and make a new payment with the correct delivery address.

Learn more about our Seller Protection.

What documents or information can I provide as proof of shipment or delivery for intangible items?

For intangible goods, proof of shipment or delivery means compelling evidence to show that the item was delivered, or the purchase order was fulfilled.

Compelling evidence could include a system of record showing the date the item was sent and that it was either:

Electronically sent to the recipient, including the recipient’s address (email, IP, etc.), where applicable; or
Received or accessed by the recipient.
Please also make sure you fulfill the intangible goods additional requirements.
`,
`
How is the dispute rate calculated and how do I avoid being charged a dispute fee?
The dispute rate for a seller is determined when the dispute is created. It’s based on the ratio of the total transaction amount of all Item Not Received and Significantly Not as Described claims that a seller receives compared to the total amount of their sales for the previous 3 calendar months.

A merchant’s total claims include all Item Not Received and Significantly Not as Described claims that are filed either directly with and escalated to PayPal or with the buyer’s card issuer or bank. Total claims don’t include claims for unauthorized transactions.

A merchant’s dispute rate can change between the Standard rate and the High Volume rate over time. For any given transaction dispute, the applicable dispute fee will be based on the seller’s dispute rate when the case is created.

What is defined as a High Volume Dispute Fee & a Standard Dispute Fee?
If a seller had more than 100 sales transactions in the previous three full months and their dispute rate over that time was 1.5% or more, they will be charged the High Volume Dispute Fee for each dispute. Otherwise, the Standard Dispute Fee will be applicable for each dispute.  

How can sellers in the Standard Dispute Fee scenario avoid being charged the fee for a dispute? 
Sellers won’t be charged a Standard Dispute Fee for disputes that are:    

Inquiries in PayPal’s Resolution Center that are not escalated to a claim with PayPal. 
Resolved directly between seller and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.
Filed by the buyer directly with PayPal as an Unauthorized Transaction. 
Eligible for PayPal’s Seller Protection program.
Claims with a transaction value that is less than twice the amount of the Standard Dispute fee.    
Decided in seller’s favor by PayPal or by the issuer.  
How can sellers in the High Volume Dispute Fee scenario avoid being charged the fee for a dispute? 
Sellers won’t be charged a High Volume Dispute fee for disputes that are:    

Inquiries in PayPal’s Resolution Center and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.    
Resolved directly between seller and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with PayPal..    
Filed by the buyer directly with PayPal as an Unauthorized Transaction. 
How will High Volume Dispute Fee merchants be treated differently than other merchants?
High Volume Dispute Fee merchants will be charged a higher fee for disputes filed by their customers, compared to Standard dispute rate merchants in their market. Merchants in this tier won’t be able to take advantage of certain exclusions and will be charged a Dispute Fee for all claims and chargebacks which are not amicably resolved, regardless of the dispute outcome.  

How will PayPal notify merchants of their dispute rate?
PayPal will notify merchants of their Dispute rate periodically. This may include emails to the merchants’ account email address, merchant reports, and in the Resolution center.  

Where can I see the dispute rate for my PayPal account?
You will find your Dispute Rate & Dispute Fee Tier in the Resolution Center.   

Where can I see the fee amount charged to my account and my case?
Go to the dispute details on your Case Summary Page to see if you were charged the Dispute Fee.   

Will High Dispute Fee merchants be provided any notice prior to the implementation of the Dispute Fee?
Merchants who would fall into the High Dispute Fee tier will be given a 90-day grace period after User Agreement changes related to the Dispute Fee become effective for their region. They can use this time to bring down their dispute rate to avoid being charged higher fees associated with their claims.  

Will fees be reimbursed if the merchant appeals and wins a case?
Yes, if a merchant appeals and wins the case, both the disputed amount and the Standard Dispute Fee may be reimbursed. 

The High Volume Dispute Fee, if applicable, will not be reimbursed because it does not depend on the case outcome.  

Does the Dispute Fee impact Chargeback fees on unbranded (DCC) PayPal transactions?
Disputes on unbranded transactions will not be charged a Dispute Fee, but will continue to be charged the Chargeback fee, according to the existing Chargeback fee policies and Seller Protection eligibility.

`
How do I add tracking information to my dispute for the item I sent back to the seller?
When you've sent the ‘not as described’ item back to the seller, you’ll need to let us know the tracking information.

Here's how to provide your tracking information:   

Go to the Resolution Center. (The Resolution Center is only accessible on a web browser, not the PayPal app.)    
Click Respond beside your claim.    
Choose Provide Tracking information.    
Enter your information and click Submit.
When we confirm that the item is returned, we’ll refund you.  Refunds to bank accounts can take up to 5 days, while refunds to credit or debit cards can take up to 30 days.    

We usually give a timeframe of 10 days to return the item and provide us with the tracking information. If we don’t receive valid tracking from you within 10 days, your claim may be closed.

You are responsible for the shipping costs when returning the item to the seller.

`
What is a case report?
This info is only applicable to business accounts.  

Case Reports lets you view, sort, and download the details of the buyer complaints and chargeback cases associated with your account.   

We update the data in the Case Report daily. Any changes to cases after the daily update will be captured the next day.

Here's how to download a Case Report:      

Got to your Reports.     
Click Disputes and chargebacks.     
Choose a status, date range and format.      
Click Create Report.
This report includes:    

The current state of any open cases.   
All claims that have changed state in the past reporting period (generally 24 hours).   
Claims opened within the last 2 years that haven't been resolved.   
Changes to dispute and claim activity that might affect the seller’s daily support operations, financial accounting, or transactional history.
`,
`
Do I still need to make payments if I have an open dispute on a transaction funded by Pay Monthly?
Yes, payments will still need to be made on the Pay Monthly Installment loan while the dispute is in process. Please continue to check your Pay Monthly installment loan’s payment schedule to see when payments are required.

If the dispute is resolved in your favor, the disputed amount reduces the Pay Monthly outstanding balance. Any amount paid in excess of your outstanding loan balance will be a credit on your Pay Monthly account and will be refunded to your PayPal Balance account if you have one, or to your PayPal account if you do not have a PayPal Balance account.

If a dispute is resolved in the merchant’s favor, future payments are expected to continue as stated in your existing payment schedule or the updated payment schedule provided to you after the dispute is resolved via email (if applicable).
`,
`
Will my Pay Monthly payments be the same after my dispute case is closed?
It depends on how the case is resolved. If the dispute is resolved in your favor, the disputed amount reduces the Pay Monthly outstanding balance. If there’s a loan balance remaining, you’re responsible for repaying that balance according to its existing payment schedule.

If the dispute is resolved in the merchant’s favor, you’re responsible for repaying your Pay Monthly loan in accordance with your Loan Agreement and existing payment schedule.
`,
`
What if there’s an issue with one of my packages?
The PayPal app includes a package tracking feature that offers live shipping updates for things you buy with or without PayPal. Package tracking checks directly with the carriers that deliver your packages and passes the info to you so you can track your packages in one place.

If there’s a delay or other issue with a package, we’ll update you as quickly as possible. We’ll also equip you with the tracking number, a link to the carrier, and other details that may help you resolve the issue.

For shipping issues like delays, whom should I contact?
The best place to start is the carrier. While we try to provide updates, info, and links to the carrier when there’s an issue, we, unfortunately, can’t control the carriers or talk to them on your behalf.

A quick tip: Tap on your package on the Package tracking screen to view more details about your package’s current location and any recent updates. Then, you can also tap on the tracking number (when available) to go to the carrier site for further details or to check on a possible issue.

Whom should I contact if items are missing or significantly different than how they were described?
We recommend trying the merchant first. They may have options ready to resolve common issues with items and orders.

If you need further assistance, we can help. Remember, Package tracking can track the delivery of things you buy with or without PayPal. If the items were purchased using PayPal, they might be eligible for Purchase Protection. Visit How to file a dispute for more information.

Is something wrong if packages in my list appear as the store URL or a tracking number?
Not necessarily. If it’s an automatically tracked package, sometimes the store name may not be available to us. In that situation, we’ll show the store URL or tracking number to help you identify the package.

If you added a package manually but didn’t include a nickname, it will be named based on the carrier and tracking number.

Are there any packages I can’t track?
As long as it’s shipped with a tracking number from a carrier, we can help you track it. Sometimes, stores and sellers don’t provide tracking numbers for certain packages, so you won’t see them in our app.
`,
`
How do I return an item to the seller?
If the case is decided in your favor, you must return the item to the seller within 10 days and let us know the tracking number and shipping company.  Please follow our specific instructions when sending the item(s) back.

Check the email we sent or your Resolution Center to see what you need to do.   

When we confirm the item is returned, we’ll refund you. Refunds to bank accounts can take up to 5 days, while refunds to credit or debit cards can take up to 30 days. Note: You’ll have to cover the return shipping costs.
`,
`
How do I respond to a pre-chargeback alert?
What’s a pre-chargeback alert?

A pre-chargeback alert is a type of case notification sent to merchants to help identify transactions possibly receiving a chargeback. These aren’t actual chargebacks but only an indicator of possible chargebacks. 

How will I receive a pre-chargeback alert?

You’ll receive an alert as a new case in the Resolution Center. You’ll be notified about the case through all the usual notification channels.

You can view these alerts using the “Case type” filter in the Resolution Center. A pre-chargeback alert row gets shown as “High Priority.”  

Can I respond to a pre-chargeback alert?

Yes, you can respond to these alerts in the Resolution Center. You’ll get a 20-hour window to issue refunds for transactions without fulfilling orders and avoiding any applicable fees.  

If you’ve successfully fulfilled the order, within or outside the 20-hour window, you can also provide evidence in the alert. PayPal will use this evidence to contest the chargeback when it arrives.  

Why should I respond within the 20-hour window?

As a benefit, if you respond with a refund to your buyer within the 20-hour window, you can avoid getting a chargeback and any associated chargeback fees.  

Will I be able to respond outside this window?

Yes, you can choose to respond outside the 20-hour window as well. You’ll get the regular ten days to respond after that. If you choose to do that,  you may be unable to avoid receiving a chargeback or the associated fee.
`,
`
Get help with an order you didn’t receive.
Contact the seller and check the shipping information
If you order something with PayPal and you don’t receive the item, the first step is to contact the seller in your Resolution Centre. If available, you should check the delivery information and see when the package shipped. If it has already passed the expected delivery date, tell the seller it hasn't come.

Most sellers will help you track your purchase or arrange a replacement item.

Report that you haven't received your item
In some cases, however, a seller may not respond or be able to resolve the problem. If this happens to you, we’re on your side! PayPal Purchase Protection helps buyers who make purchases and don't receive the item, or it differs from what they ordered. To get things going, open a dispute in the Resolution Center.

Make sure you file your dispute within the correct dispute-filing timeframe. You and the seller will have 20 days to work things out. After that, a dispute will automatically close if neither party takes further action. A closed dispute cannot be reopened.

Ask PayPal to step in and help

If your initial attempt to resolve the problem with the seller in your Resolution Centre is unsuccessful, you can escalate your case to a claim. 

We'll then investigate your case, and if we can't find a satisfactory resolution with the seller, we'll refund your money.

The time it takes us to decide the outcome can vary. It depends on how quickly both parties respond to our enquiries and whether or not we need more information.

We usually reach a decision within 14 days, but some cases can take 30 days or longer.

If your item arrives late after receiving a refund, you should work with your seller to return it or pay for it again. You can ask the seller how they would like to proceed and stick to the instructions.
`,
`
Get help with an item that is different from what you ordered or fake.
My item arrived – but it’s different from what I ordered.

If an item you bought has arrived but doesn't match the description at the time of purchase and your payment is eligible,  we have your back. The first thing would always be to contact the seller by looking at the contact information in the transaction details and trying to work things out. Otherwise, you can open a dispute for an item significantly different from what was described.

For example:

You received a completely different item. Example: You purchased a tennis racket but received a tennis bag.
The item's condition was misrepresented. Example: The listing said "new," but the item was clearly used.
The item is missing parts or features, and this was not disclosed. Example: You bought a lamp that showed up with no bulb.
You purchased a specific quantity of an item but received the wrong amount. Example: You bought two smartphones but received only one.
The item was damaged en route to its destination. Example: Your mirror was broken in transit.
You received a fake or counterfeit version of the item. Example: For instance, you bought a designer leather jacket, but it was actually a replica made of synthetic material.
We do not cover buyer's remorse instances; ensuring you genuinely desire an item before finalizing the transaction is essential.

Make sure you file your dispute within the correct dispute-filing timeframe. You and the seller will have 20 days to work things out. After that, a dispute will automatically close if neither party takes further action. A closed dispute cannot be reopened.

If the case is decided in your favor, you must return the item to the seller within 10 days and let us know the tracking number and shipping company.  Please follow our specific instructions when sending the item(s) back.

Check the email we sent or your Resolution Center to see what you need to do.   

When we confirm the item is returned, we’ll refund you. Refunds to bank accounts can take up to 5 days, while refunds to credit or debit cards can take up to 30 days. Note: You’ll have to cover the return shipping costs.
`,
`
What should I do if I didn't receive all my items or if one or more were late?
We encourage sellers to ship items as soon as they receive payment. Most sellers ship items within 7 days. (Allow extra time for international shipments).

Occasionally, a seller may contact you if an item is out of stock. At that point, you can decide if you want to wait longer for that item or request a refund.

If you have waited a reasonable time for the shipment and have no updates from the seller, you can decide to open a dispute for the missing item(s).

Here's how to open a dispute from the web:

Go to the Resolution Center and click Report a Problem.
Select the payment and click Continue.
Select the reason for your dispute, such as:
Unauthorized activity in your PayPal account (a payment you don't recognize or are confident you didn't authorize).
Issues with your purchase (a purchase doesn’t arrive or match the seller’s description).
Issues with the Seller (a seller is not co-operating and doesn’t respond to your messages, or you're simply unable to reach an agreement).
Billing errors or Issues with subscriptions (you've been charged more than once).
Select the option that best describes your issue and click Continue.
To open a dispute on the app:

Go to Activity and tap the transaction you want to report.
Scroll to the bottom and tap Report a Problem.
Select the type of issue you have, including any relevant details, and tap Submit.


If your item arrives late after receiving a refund, you should work with your seller to return it or pay for it again. You can ask the seller how they would like to proceed and stick to the instructions.

How do I remove a limitation from my account?
Before you begin

A limited account means that you won’t be able to do certain things with your PayPal account. For example, you might not be able to send or withdraw money. Usually, we ask you to complete some steps to remove your account limitation.

Go to your Resolution Center or click the bell icon at the top of your Dashboard for more info.

If all the steps are completed and your account remains limited, it either means:

We've already reviewed your account and sent you an email asking for more information.
We're still reviewing the information you provided.
If you're required to upload documents, review our tips for submitting documents.

The time it takes to resolve an account limitation depends on the complexity of your specific case.

In most cases, our customer service team can't remove your limitation over the phone. Please wait for us to contact you.

If you received an email stating your account is limited, but don't see a limitation in the Resolution Center, you may have received a fake email. Forward it to phishing@paypal.com and we'll investigate it for you.

After you forward us the email, delete it from your inbox. If you clicked any links or downloaded any attachments, log in to your account and view your payments. It's also a good idea to change your password.
`,
`
Why is my PayPal account limited?
If we’ve limited your account, we'll send you an email with the reason for the limitation.

Before you begin

A limited account means that you won’t be able to do certain things with your PayPal account. For example, you might not be able to send or withdraw money. Usually, we ask you to complete some steps to remove your account limitation.

Go to your Resolution Center or click the bell icon at the top of your Dashboard for more info.

Reasons for Account Limitations
We may limit an account for several reasons, such as:

Regulatory requirements
We may limit your account to comply with regulatory requirements. For example, requesting certain products, like a debit card, can trigger governmental laws. We may limit your account while we work together to satisfy those requirements.

Acceptable Use Policy
If you're not in compliance with our Acceptable Use Policy, we can limit your account. Violations of the Acceptable Use Policy include selling banned items such as prescription drugs or guns.

Unauthorized use
We may limit your account to protect you from potential losses and review any fraudulent activity. This can happen if your:

Account was accessed without your authorization
Bank informs us there have been unauthorized transfers between your PayPal account and your bank account
Debit or credit card issuer alerts us that someone may have used your card without your permission
Higher risk activity
We may limit your account if your seller performance indicates high risk activity. This can happen if you:

Receive an unusually high number of claims and chargebacks from your buyers, which are an indication of poor seller performance
Start selling an entirely new type of product, such as a higher-cost item like jewelry
Experience rapidly increasing sales volume, which is out of nature with your usual sales patterns
In these cases, we may limit your account while we do a review.

Inactive account
We may limit your account if you haven't used it much since you signed up.

To restore full access to your account, log in and upload your Proof of Identity (such as a copy of your driver's license or state ID). You can upload this document in your Notifications center.

In most cases, our customer service team can't remove your limitation over the phone. Please wait for us to contact you.

If you received an email stating your account is limited, but don't see a limitation in the Resolution Center, you may have received a fake email. Forward it to phishing@paypal.com and we'll investigate it for you.

After you forward us the email, delete it from your inbox. If you clicked any links or downloaded any attachments, log in to your account and view your payments. It's also a good idea to change your password.
`,
`
How long will it take to lift my PayPal account limitation?
When the required steps have been completed, the review of the account usually takes 3 business days. We'll contact you via email once the review is completed.

We may automatically lift some limitations when you complete the steps. For instance, you may simply need to change your password and security questions.

Before you begin

A limited account means that you won’t be able to do certain things with your PayPal account. For example, you might not be able to send or withdraw money. Usually, we ask you to complete some steps to remove your account limitation.

Go to your Resolution Center or click the bell icon at the top of your Dashboard for more info.
`,
`
What kind of documentation can I provide to remove my account limitation?
If we’ve limited your account, we may ask you for documentation that helps us confirm you or your business. We may request documentation related to your identity, address, recent name change, or business.

You can find a list of requested documents in the Resolution Center.

Before sending us anything, be sure your document:

Is legible.
Shows all 4 corners of the page.
Doesn’t have information blocked or blacked out.
Matches the information on your PayPal account.

How will PayPal use my TIN or SSN and how do I add it?
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced transitional reporting requirements for payments received for goods and services, which will lower the federal Form 1099-K reporting threshold over a 3-year period. We’ve summarized the IRS thresholds for Form 1099-K below.

For the tax year 2024 (form available in 2025,) the Federal Reporting Threshold is more than $5,000 USD in gross sales from goods or services in the calendar year.

For the tax year 2025 (form available in 2026,) the Federal Reporting Threshold is more than $2,500 USD in gross sales from goods or services in the calendar year.

For the tax year 2026 (form available in 2027,) the Federal Reporting Threshold is more than $600 USD in gross sales from goods or services in the calendar year.

You may have been notified to provide your Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and confirm your tax status if you’ve received payments for goods or services through PayPal, and don’t have a TIN updated in our records. This is required by the IRS and US state revenue authorities.

To ensure that payment information is accurately reported, where required, please update your account information by providing a TIN to avoid any potential limitations (such as tax holds) and 24% backup withholding. A TIN can be a Social Security Number (SSN), Employer Identification Number (EIN), or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN.)

If you have multiple PayPal accounts, you’ll need to confirm your taxpayer status for each account. You will also receive a tax form for each applicable PayPal account.

Here's how to confirm your taxpayer status in 3 steps for each of your PayPal accounts.

Log in through the Confirm Taxpayer Status Button in the email we’ve sent you.
Choose your taxpayer status from the dropdown menu.
Enter your US TIN, your name, and your business type.
Here’s how to add your TIN to your PayPal account:

Click the Settings icon next to "Log out."
Click Add your SSN.
Add your information and click Save.
Then, if necessary, we’ll send you the relevant tax form in January per IRS reporting requirements. If you’ve already entered your TIN, you may have received a notification if the information doesn’t match IRS records. Log in to confirm that it’s correct.

Sole proprietors and single-member LLCs:

When confirming your taxpayer status, enter your name as it appears in line 1 of your 1040, 1040A, or 1040EZ. If you’d rather provide your Employer Identification Number, submit your Form W-9 to ensure that what we enter on your Form 1099-K matches IRS records. You can upload your completed tax form through your PayPal account using the alert dashboard, Message Center, or limitation.

`
What should I do if my account becomes limited because I did not provide the requested FATCA information?
If we’ve limited your account, you’ll still be able to view and share the required Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) documentation.

Here's how to complete the FATCA requirements:

Log in to your PayPal account.
Click the Notifications icon at the top of the page and follow the link.
Confirm your tax status.
Input your personal or business information as requested.
Read and review the certification before signing it with your electronic or written signature. False statements may lead to penalties under applicable law. If you have any questions or concerns regarding the form, it may be beneficial to contact a tax advisor.

The certification process is complete when you have:


Shared all requested information,
Reviewed the certification webpage, and
Entered your electronic or written signature.
Once you’ve completed this process, your account should no longer be subject to the limitations applied because of the FATCA reporting requirements. Any other limitations or restrictions on your account will still apply.
`,
`
Why is PayPal requesting information about my business?
From time to time we may request you to provide some extra information about your business, such as your supplier details, invoices and bank statements. This can happen if we notice a change in selling patterns or an increase in buyer complaints.

Before you begin

A limited account means that you won’t be able to do certain things with your PayPal account. For example, you might not be able to send or withdraw money. Usually, we ask you to complete some steps to remove your account limitation.

Go to your Resolution Center or click the bell icon at the top of your Dashboard for more info.

When the required steps have been completed, the review of the account usually takes 3 business days. We'll contact you via email once the review is completed.

How do I spot a fake, fraudulent, or phishing PayPal email or website?
If you receive a message and are unsure it’s really from PayPal, check to see if it does any of the following:

Uses impersonal, generic greetings, such as “Dear user” or “Dear [your email address].” Our emails will always address you by your first and last names or by your business name. We never say things like "Dear user" or "Hello PayPal member.”
Asks you to click on links that take you to a fake website. Always check links in an email before you click them. A link could look perfectly secure like www.paypal.com/SpecialOffers. Make sure to move your mouse over the link to see the true destination. If you aren’t certain, don’t click on the link.
Contains unknown attachments. Only open an attachment if you're sure it's legitimate and secure. Be particularly cautious of invoices from companies and contractors you're not familiar with. Some attachments contain viruses that install themselves when opened.
Conveys a false sense of urgency. Phishing emails are often alarmist, warning you to update your account immediately. They're hoping you'll fall for their sense of urgency and ignore warning signs that the email is fake. If there’s an urgent need for you to complete something on your account, you can find this information by logging into PayPal directly.  
The following are common scams where fraudsters use spoofed emails.

"Your account is about to be suspended." Many fraudsters send spoofed emails warning you that your account is about to be suspended. The email will ask you to enter your password on a (spoofed) webpage. We’ll only ask you to enter your password on our login page. Always log in to PayPal and view the Resolution Center for any notifications.
"You've received a payment." Some fraudsters try to trick you into thinking you've received a payment for an order. They want what you're selling for free. Before you ship anything, log in to PayPal and check that you actually received a payment. We'll never ask you to share a tracking number by email. If you received a payment, you’ll always see it in your PayPal activity.​ 
"You’ve been paid too much." Fraudsters may try to convince you that they overpaid for an item. For example, they’ll send an email that says they’ve paid you $500.00 USD for a camera you listed at $300.00 USD. The sender asks you to ship the camera in addition to the extra $200.00 USD you were “paid” by mistake. The fraudster wants your camera AND your payment but hasn’t actually paid you at all. Before sending anything, login to PayPal and check that you received a payment. 
To report a suspicious email or website, forward it to phishing@paypal.com. After you send us the email, delete it from your inbox.

How do I confirm my identity? (CIP)
We will be making some enhancements to our CIP for our individual customers. Through our new biometric identity verification process, we can use the latest technology to help protect you against identity theft and fraudulent activity quickly and efficiently.

For regulatory reasons, we need to confirm our customer's personal information (such as your name, address and date of birth) or company information. This is what we call our Customer Identification Process (CIP).


What’s facial biometric identity verification?
Facial Biometric identity verification is a secure way of confirming your identity by scanning your driver’s license or Government-issued photo id (front and back) and matching it with a selfie you take of your face.

How does facial biometric confirmation work?
Using your device’s camera, you’ll scan your photo ID and your face. Then we compare the scans to confirm your identity.

What do I need to do?
When receiving PayPal’s notification to confirm your identity, you’ll need to download or update the latest version of the PayPal app to proceed with the process.

Can you confirm another way?
Yes. Instead of scanning, use a computer to log into Paypal and provide the required information.

What can I upload?
To complete the Customer Identification Program (CIP), we'll usually need a copy of your government-issued ID, and a proof of address issued within the past 12 months. You can take photos of them with your phone and upload them to us.

Business accounts will have to submit business-related documents.

How do I upload files using my PayPal account?
You upload files to your PayPal account. Log in to your PayPal account on a web browser and go to your Confirm your Identity page, or click the bell icon near the top of the page. 

How long will it take to review my documents?
We’ll try to review your documents within 2 business days, but sometimes it may take longer.

What if I don’t want to confirm my identity?
If you don't confirm your identity, you may lose some PayPal features, like the ability to add money to PayPal from your bank account.

What if I’ve already uploaded the documents for my other PayPal account?
We need you to upload documents separately for each PayPal account.

What does the status of my payment or money request mean on my PayPal account?
Here are some definitions to help you understand the status of a payment or money request you sent:

Payment 

Pending: We’re reviewing the transaction. We’ll send your payment to the recipient after your payment source has been verified. If you've sent an eCheck, it usually takes up to 7 business days to clear, the transaction will show as 'Pending' on your Summary page.
On hold: We’re holding the money temporarily because either you filed a dispute or we’re reviewing the transaction. Look for an email from us with more information about this transaction.
Held: We’re reviewing the transaction and so your payment has been held. You should check the Resolution Center for more information.
Temporary hold: Money from your account is being held temporarily during the authorization process. The recipient isn’t able to use or withdraw this money until the authorization is complete.
Refunded: The recipient refunded your payment. If you used a credit card to make your payment, the money will be returned to your credit card. It can take up to 30 days for the refund to appear on your statement.
Returned: Money was returned to your account because the recipient didn’t claim your payment within 30 days. PayPal members can manually reverse unclaimed payments before the 30-day automatic reversal.
Denied: The recipient didn’t accept your payment, and the money was credited back to your account. View the transaction details to see why your payment was denied or contact the recipient for more information.
Unclaimed: The recipient hasn’t accepted or received your payment. Unclaimed transactions are automatically canceled after 30 days.
Completed: The transaction was successful and the money is in the recipient’s account.
Money request 

Pending: The money has not been paid by the recipient of the request.
Completed: The transaction was successful and the money is in your account.

The requestor will have access to the deceased customer’s bank account to transfer the balance to the bank account linked to the PayPal account.
Once we’ve received this information, we'll review the documents and, upon approval, will close or lock the account.

What's the difference between friends and family or goods and services payments?
When you send money, we ask you to choose a payment type. You can send money as:

a personal payment to friends and family (“Sending to a friend”)
a purchase for goods and services (“Paying for an item or service”)
Personal Payments

Choose “Sending to a friend” for the everyday exchange of money between you and your friends and family. You can use personal payments when you send money as a gift, split a lunch bill, pay your share of living expenses, or something similar.  

Personal payments aren't covered by PayPal Purchase Protection.

Fees

You can make a personal payment to anyone in the US for free if you use your bank account or PayPal Balance. If you use a debit or credit card, there will be a small charge for your payment.

Go to our Fees page for more information.

Note: We're currently unable to allow personal payments to or from India.

Purchases for Goods and Services

Choose “Paying for an item or service” when buying goods or services. You can use this type of payment when you pay for an item you won in an auction, buy merchandise online, download a digital item, or something similar.

We cover eligible goods and services payments under PayPal Purchase Protection.

Fees

When you make this type of payment, the seller pays a small fee to receive your money. Go to our Fees page for more information.

`
Why am I receiving emails or texts from PayPal when I don’t have an account?
You may receive emails from us because someone registered a PayPal account with your email. They may have mistakenly typed the email address during sign-up or intentionally used an email address that wasn’t theirs.

A domain provider like Gmail or Hotmail may have also recycled your email address. If you have an email account and don’t use it for a while, the domain provider can reissue it to the public for use by someone else.

If you receive a message and are unsure it’s really from PayPal, always remember to check for the red flags shown in this video.




If you don't have a PayPal account but are receiving PayPal emails you can email us at UnsolicitedEmail@paypal.com.

You will need to:

Email us using the email address that you're receiving PayPal emails
Include a statement acknowledging you do not have a PayPal account and would like your email removed from the PayPal system
We can't reply to any general account questions or inquiries via the UnsolicitedEmail@paypal.com address.

If you do not have a PayPal account but you receive an SMS suggesting that you've attempted to log in, you can ignore these messages. It's most likely they are phishing attempts sent to random phone numbers.

If you do have a PayPal account and you're receiving these messages about log in attempts, at times you're not trying to log in, this suggests that someone has your password.

When you have Two-Factor Authentication set up on your account and any log in is attempted, we'll send you an SMS to confirm that it's you logging in. The SMS will come from one of our numbers, for example, 729725 or 72975.

This Two-Factor Authentication step must be completed before your account can be accessed. So, if you receive this SMS when you're not attempting to log in, we recommend that you log in to your PayPal account and change your password immediately.

`

Why do I have to complete a security check?
To deliver a secure service, we may ask you to confirm your identity. We do this to make sure it's you, using the PayPal account. We'll also ask if we see new or unusual activity, like a log in from a new device or different location. 

At times, we may show you one of several options to confirm your identity:

Receive a text
Have us call you
Confirm some info about yourself
Answer your security questions
Confirm your credit card number
Receive an email


If the security check isn’t successful, we have some troubleshooting tips for you below.

Receive a text

If you don’t receive our text message, you should contact your mobile phone carrier. Ask them to turn on short-code text messaging. Depending on the scenario, we’ll send you one of 2 texts.

We may ask you to confirm your activity (Reply 1 for yes or 2 for no).

Otherwise, we’ll send a 6-digit code, that you’ll need to enter. You’ll see the code in the body of the text. It’s not the PayPal phone number.

This code expires after 5-10 minutes. If your code expires, click Resend, if the option is available.

You might have more than 1 phone number, so click Change to choose which number will receive the text. If your phone number has changed, click Add to enter your current number.

If you see an error, your name or address on PayPal may not have matched your phone billing statement. Our system can’t always match details, causing an error message. For example, if you’re not the primary account holder on a family mobile plan, the details won’t match. Spelling variations, a maiden name, or other mismatches will also cause this error.

If you have another phone number in your name, try adding that number instead. 

Have us call you

Our system will call the number on your account. We’ll ask you to confirm certain activities. If you miss this call, choose Have us call you again.

Confirm some info about yourself

You’ll need to answer some questions to verify your identity. These questions come from a public database dating back as far as 20 years. They may be about property, places, or people you know. We don’t save or store the questions or answers in our system.

Answer your security questions

If you choose this option, you’ll need to answer the security questions you’ve chosen since signing up. The questions may be about your friends, employers, or places you’ve lived.

Confirm your card number

We’ll ask you to enter the full credit card number, for a card you use on your PayPal account. If you can't log in, try to add another credit card to your PayPal account.  

Receive an email

If you choose to receive an email we’ll send a 6-digit code to the email address you use for PayPal. This code expires after 5-10 minutes. If you missed the timeframe, click Resend. Enter the code on the screen and click Continue. If you don’t see an email, check your spam or junk folder.  

Push Notification

If you see a screen like the one below while trying to log in or complete a payment, check your mobile phone for a push notification that asks permission to proceed. Choose the desired option and the screen will automatically take you to the next step.

What is Venmo and how does it work?
Venmo is a social payment service to make and share payments with friends, family, and businesses in the United States. It’s like PayPal, but is unique in that, on Venmo, you can share and like payments through a social feed.

Use Venmo to:

Send and receive payments with your email or phone number by using your US bank, debit/credit card, or Venmo balance as the payment method
Open a Teen Account for your teens
Transfer money to and from your bank account
Make purchases with your Venmo Debit Card or Venmo Credit Card
Pay using QR codes in-store or on authorized partner apps or mobile websites
PayPal merchants will have an expanded consumer audience in the US as customers can now use their Venmo accounts to make purchases during a mobile PayPal checkout. Merchants’ fees and protections will remain consistent with their PayPal payments, and you don’t have to do anything to complete this integration.

How do I set myself up to send money from my Venmo account to my PayPal account?
At this time, it's not possible to link your Venmo and PayPal accounts. If you want to send money to your PayPal account via Visa+, the first step is making sure your PayPal account is properly set up with a Payname.

Visa+ payments cannot be canceled or reversed, so it’s important to make sure they’re going to the right place.

Once you’re sure you have your PayPal Payname, follow these steps:

Go to the Me tab.
Tap the Settings gear in the top right.
Tap Send Money to PayPal.
Tap Send.
Enter your PayPal Payname.
Enter the dollar amount you want to send.
Confirm the payment details and then hit Next.
Important:

Visa+ payments cannot be canceled or reversed. Please ensure the details are correct. Payments sent to the wrong Payname or account could be lost.
You’ll need to confirm the last four digits of the phone number on your PayPal account to complete the payment.
It can take up to 30 minutes for the money to get to the other account.
If you have additional questions or would like to learn more about Venmo, please go to our Venmo Help Center or User Agreement.

If you need assistance with your Venmo account, please reach out to our Venmo customer support.

Where can I find details about the account types PayPal offers?
We offer two types of accounts to meet all of your needs, Personal or Business accounts.

If you just need to make purchases and send money to family and friends, a Personal account is probably for you. We recommend Business accounts for online merchants who operate under a company or group name. PayPal is free when you make purchases and when you send money to family and friends from your bank account. If you can hold a balance with PayPal, you can also use it to send money to family and friends for free.

If you use a credit or debit card to send money to family and friends, a fee applies. The sender decides who pays the fee. If you use your PayPal account to request money from someone, you'll be charged a fee when you receive the payment.

For more information on fees, click Fees at the bottom of any PayPal page.

You can read more about our various policies in the PayPal User Agreement.

I have a problem with my PayPal transaction, but I can't find it on my PayPal account. What do I do?
If you see a PayPal transaction on your credit or debit card statement, but don’t have a PayPal account, or can’t find the transaction in your PayPal account, it’s likely that your payment was completed through our guest checkout.

A guest checkout transaction happens when PayPal is used as the payment processor, but you weren’t logged into your PayPal account at the time of the purchase.

You can create a PayPal account by clicking Activate PayPal Now in the email you received at the time of your purchase. Once your account is created, you can open a dispute.

If you have a problem with your guest transaction and want to open a dispute, go to your Resolution Center and click Report a Problem.

We’ll send you a receipt every time you make a payment from your bank account, giving you an easy way to track your spending.

What is PayPal's Infringement Report process?
Our  Infringement Report  (IR) allows rights owners to identify potentially infringing activity taking place in association with a PayPal account. This process can be used to report infringement on websites or other forums offering goods or services through PayPal. 

PayPal also allows third parties to develop applications utilizing our services. For infringement associated with these applications, rights owners should first contact the developer who created and maintains the application in order to address the matter. If this does not resolve the issue, rights owners can use the IR process to report the infringement to PayPal.

Why am I suspended from PayPal Seller Protection? How do I become eligible again?
To ensure a safer transaction environment, your eligibility for PayPal Seller Protection may be suspended during regular account reviews. This usually happens when one or more of the following activities are detected on your PayPal account:

There's an increased risk associated with your PayPal account.
Your PayPal account is linked to another PayPal account that has been suspended.
Providing excellent customer service and reducing the risk of fraud for your customers can help you regain and maintain your eligibility for PayPal Seller Protection.


Providing excellent customer service

Offer a refund and post your return policy so customers can see it.
Use a reputable shipping service.
Set up a customer service message within your PayPal account.
Be professional, helpful, and courteous if a customer contacts you. Post customer service contact information, including working hours and response time.

Reducing the risk of fraud

Provide detailed and accurate descriptions of items for sale and include pictures from multiple angles.
Verify the customer’s order information before shipping, such as the address and phone number. If an order looks suspicious, contact the customer to verify the information. Also, delay shipping high-risk orders and avoid sending them overnight unless you are confident the order is legitimate.
Use tools to detect fraud, such as IP geolocation, device identification, fraud filters, etc.
Keep your credit card statement name updated to ensure your customers can recognize your transaction easily on their card statement.
Review orders for anything unusual, such as:
Shipping to a high-risk country
Orders that are larger than normal
Requests for change of shipping address after the order has been paid for
Abnormally large numbers of international orders within a short period
Several orders from different customers shipping to the same address
Overpayments with additional requests
Rush or overnight shipping
Orders from a suspicious email address
Orders from a suspicious postal address (e.g., PO boxes, vacant buildings)
Multiple separate orders from the same PayPal account

Supported activities by PayPal
Why does PayPal support certain activities and not others?
PayPal partners with card networks and various banks to provide a secure payment platform to our customers. Our partners have specific rules and restrictions for certain activities, transactions, and business models that are intended to maintain the safety of these networks. As required by these card network rules, PayPal abides by these requirements as well as applicable local laws and our own policies to maintain a safe environment and community for our users. Our platform cannot support activities that are prohibited by these requirements. In other cases, we may only be able to support certain activities with pre-approval.

How does PayPal interact with Card Networks and Bank Partners?
PayPal serves as a secure bridge to seamlessly process our customers’ online transactions. To process a transaction, PayPal sends transaction details to our bank partners. We rely on these bank partners to transmit the transaction details to the relevant card network. The card network then routes the transaction for approval by the bank that issued the card used for payment. The card networks help to ensure that valid transactions are authorized and approved, and that the funds are available so PayPal customers can ultimately receive those payments.

This collaboration with card networks and bank partners is crucial in supporting our mission to provide a secure and convenient online payment experience for consumers and merchants.

Where can I get more information?
Our Acceptable Use Policy and User Agreement detail the activities that are prohibited or need pre-approval based on PayPal’s requirements from card networks and bank partners as well as applicable laws and policies. The User Agreement also covers what steps we may take if we identify potential breaches of those requirements. Refer to this section of the User Agreement for details.

Please visit our Help Center home page to access other articles on how to use your PayPal account as well as a link to contact customer service. To learn more about addressing account limitations, please refer to How do I remove a limitation from my account? To report or resolve an issue with your account, please visit our Resolution Center so that we can work with you to find a solution.

What is PayPal Fundraisers and how does it work?
PayPal Fundraisers is a way for you to create a fundraiser for yourself, someone else, a group, business, or a charity. 

You can raise a maximum of $20,000 USD and run the fundraiser for up to 30 days. 

On October 7, 2024, PayPal disabled the ability to create Fundraisers as PayPal is discontinuing the PayPal Fundraisers program and services.

All current Fundraisers will remain open until they expire. You will need to move any funds from your existing Fundraisers into your PayPal balance no later than January 12, 2025. If you do not do so, we’ll move any remaining funds into your PayPal balance on January 13, 2025.

Customers can continue to support their favorite charities in the PayPal app. To get started, open the PayPal app, go to the menu, scroll down, and tap Donate under “Send and Pay” to find over one million charities vetted by PayPal.

When customers donate on the PayPal website or in the app, PayPal covers the transaction fees (when no currency conversion is involved), meaning 100% of their gift supports charity.

If you're a charity and want to benefit from donations raised through the PayPal app or website, please enroll with PayPal Giving Fund. 

Receiving money raised via PayPal Fundraisers

Charities that aren’t enrolled in PayPal Giving Fund are included in the PayPal Fundraising process. While unenrolled charities don’t have a PayPal account, they’ve been verified to be in good standing by PayPal Giving Fund.

Enrolled charities receive donations into their PayPal account whereas unenrolled charities receive donations via mailed check.
`,
`
Why didn’t my donation go to my recommended charity (PayPal Giving Fund)?
PayPal Giving Fund partners with leading organizations such as eBay, Meta, GoFundMe, Deed, and Twitch. As a registered charity and Donor Advised Fund, we receive donations through our partner programs and make grants to donors' recommended charities, helping to raise funds and reach new donors.

Whilst we make every effort to follow donor recommendations, sometimes we are unable to make a grant to your selected charity. Some reasons for this may include:

The charity didn't respond to us regarding delivery of funds, and the check sent was returned or refused.
The charity is no longer eligible, is revoked, or closed after you made your original donation or is no longer accepting donations.
The charity no longer meets the requirements of our Donation Delivery Policy.
In the rare cases when PayPal Giving Fund reassigns funds, we will (whenever possible) ask the donor to recommend an enrolled charity from the PayPal Giving Fund Directory to benefit from the donation. Donors can select an alternative charity to benefit from their donation by viewing our database.

Please note, the tax-deductible status of a donation doesn't change if funds are reassigned because PayPal Giving Fund is the charitable organization to which the donor's original donation is made.

Please visit our website if you'd like to learn more about PayPal Giving Fund and our policies. If you aren't a PayPal customer and have questions about PayPal Giving Fund, please contact us.

A bank reversal, sometimes known as an ACH Return, is when a bank requests us to reverse a PayPal payment. Usually, the request is due to suspected unauthorized use of the bank account. The request can come from the bank account owner or the bank itself.

`
What‘s an ACH payment?
An ACH payment is an electronic transfer of money from one US bank account to another, processed through the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network. Most Americans have been using the ACH network for years without realizing it.

PayPal uses this network whenever a customer makes a payment that’s funded from their US bank account.

It can take up to 2 business days for an ACH payment to complete and the money to appear in the recipient’s PayPal account. The payment will show as “pending” until it clears.

Before making a payment, be sure you’ve enough money in your bank account to cover it. If a payment is rejected due to insufficient funds, your PayPal balance could go negative.
`,
`
Why am I seeing a zero-dollar deposit or prenote from PayPal on my bank account?
PayPal is required by the banks that we use to process our transactions to identify inactive bank accounts that may be linked to PayPal accounts.

To do this, we send a prenotification (prenote) in the form of a zero-dollar deposit to all bank accounts on file linked to PayPal accounts. This prenote does not affect the balance of your bank account and may not show up on your monthly statement, depending on your bank. You need no action if your bank account is verified as an active account.

If your bank account is inactive, the prenote will be returned to PayPal, and we will send you an email to notify you of the inactive bank account being unlinked from your PayPal account. PayPal plans to send these prenotes every 6-12 months to ensure all linked bank accounts are still active.

`
How does my Pay Monthly payment appear on my financial institution’s debit or bank statement?

What debit or credit cards can I use with PayPal?
You can use the following cards, including prepaid cards:

Visa
Mastercard
Discover
American Express
`,
`
What if I failed to confirm my debit or credit card?
If a “Confirm Card” link appears next to your card details, you’ll need to confirm this debit or credit card before you can use it with PayPal. This step helps to make sure that the card is valid and belongs to you.

If you enter PayPal code incorrectly 5 times, the card is disabled from the PayPal system. You’ll have to contact us to help you reset it. After you re-add this card to your account, you can request PayPal code again to confirm your card.
`,
`
Where do I find the PayPal code to confirm my card?
You’ll find your 4-digit PayPal code on your debit or credit card statement near the charge amount. If your online card statement shows "pending" transactions, you’ll see the code within minutes. Otherwise, your online card statement will show the code 2-3 business days after we apply the charge. We can't provide the code by email or phone.

Your code will appear in the item description section of your statement and will look like this:


PayPal*1234 CODE or PP*1234 CODE

Here's how to finish confirming your card with your 4-digit PayPal code from a web browser:

Go to your Wallet.
Click the card you want to confirm.
Enter the 4-digit code and click Confirm.
If you don’t confirm your card, you’ll get the small amount back automatically 75 days from the date of the charge. In certain jurisdictions, the credit may not actually post to your card for 30 more days.

If you remove your card or close your account before receiving the refund, the refund may fail. In that case, simply contact us and we’ll manually refund the charge.
`,
`
Do I get charged a cash advance fee when using my debit or credit card to make a payment?
No. When you use your debit or credit card, you won’t be charged a cash advance fee for sending money for goods or services. For those payments made as gifts or to friends and family, there’s a fee that the sender can either pay or opt to have the receiver pay.

For these types of payments, PayPal charges your debit or credit card only for the payment amount.

Tip: If you make a cash advance purchase with a credit or debit card, the card issuer may charge a cash advance fee. PayPal has no control over third-party fees. To avoid incurring fees when making a cash advance purchase, you may want to use a different payment method, such as your bank account or an eCheck (if available).
`,
`
Why is the number 402-935-7733 showing on my bank or credit card statement?
When making a purchase with PayPal, the charge may appear as “PayPal” along with the number 402-935-7733 on your bank or credit card statement. You may also see this phone number, which is a phone number associated with PayPal Customer Service, if the merchant you’re shopping with uses PayPal as their credit card processor. Check your account statement with your most recent PayPal activity.

If you don’t have a PayPal account, or haven’t used it recently, please follow the steps to report an unauthorized transaction.
`,
`
Why is there a $1.95 USD charge on my card statement?
When you confirm your debit or credit card, we’ll charge your card $1.95 USD. This charge and a 4-digit PayPal code will appear on your card statement within 2-3 business days. If you request the PayPal code more than once, you’ll find more than 1 charge on your card statement. You need to use the latest code that you've requested.

After you confirm your card, we’ll immediately refund the charge. Your card issuer will credit your balance within 30 days of the refund date.

`,
`
Why did PayPal charge $1 to my card?
We make this temporary charge to every card added to PayPal. When you add or edit any card in your PayPal account, we’ll charge the card up to $1 USD to verify that this card is available for online payments.

The charge will appear in your PayPal account activity. We don’t collect the charge, so it'll show as “pending” until we’ve verified your card.

Depending on your bank, the charge will remain for a few minutes or up to 30 days. You may see it even if your card isn't approved for use on PayPal. If the charge remains on your card after 30 days, contact your card issuer.
`,
`
Why did PayPal automatically update the expiration date on my card?
We may automatically update your card’s expiration date when we have new information from your card issuer. We do this in partnership with major credit card issuers, so your payment doesn’t fail and you don’t have to update your card details manually.

What information does the card issuer provide to PayPal?
The card issuer provides us with a new card number and/or expiration date. We don't use or store your card CVV code, and the card data we receive from your card issuer is encrypted. Your card issuer can notify us of any changes to your card (except for name changes), including an account closure.

PayPal Cash and PayPal Cash Plus accounts renamed to PayPal Balance accounts
We've made some changes to the Personal accounts we're offering in the United States.   

We've upgraded the features of PayPal Cash accounts to include all the features of PayPal Cash Plus accounts and we've renamed them PayPal Balance accounts.   

Customers who don't have a Balance account can still use their Personal PayPal account to:   

Send money to someone or spend online using linked banks and cards 
Receive money and transfer it to a linked debit card or bank 
Split a bill or send money cross-border using linked banks and cards 
Sign up for and use PayPal Credit 
Do I need to do anything now that my PayPal Cash account is called a PayPal Balance account?    No, we’ve automatically made these changes. You don't need to do anything and can still use all the features you had with your PayPal Cash account.   

Here are some of the additional features you now have:  

Scan a check with our app to add money directly to your balance 
Add paychecks to your balance using Direct Deposit 
Get a PayPal Cash Card to spend your balance in stores, or withdraw as cash 
Do I need to do anything now that my PayPal Cash Plus account is called a PayPal Balance account?   

No, you don't need to do anything. We’ve automatically made these changes. 

You have all the features you do today. For example, you can:  

Keep money in your balance to easily spend, send, or hold for future purchases 
Add paychecks to your balance using Direct Deposit 
Scan a check with our app to add money directly to your balance 
Buy, sell, or hold cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin 
Get a PayPal Cash Card to spend your balance in stores or withdraw as cash 
I'm an existing PayPal Cash account holder, why am I being asked to accept PayPal Balance account disclosures again?   

We've recently introduced a new way to hold a balance and we're moving our customers' accounts to the PayPal Balance account experience over a brief period.   

If you try to access new features such as the PayPal Cash Card or Direct Deposit during this time, you may have to accept PayPal Balance account disclosures again.

How do I send a payment in another currency?
To send money in another currency:

Click Send & Request.
Enter the recipient's name, email, or phone number.
Click Next.
Enter the amount, choose the currency, and add a note if needed. Our conversion rate will be displayed. Clic Continue.
Select either, "Paying for an item or service" or "Sending to a friend" if available.
Click Continue.
Review your payment details and click Send Payment Now.
When you make a payment in a foreign currency, we calculate the conversion rate for you. You'll see the rate when you make your payment.

When you make a payment using your card, you can choose to use your card issuer's conversion rate. If you choose to use your card issuer's rate, you won't know the conversion rate right away. To find out the exact rate, you'll need to check your card statement later or contact your card issuer directly.

To select your card issuer's rate, when reviewing your payment, select the option that says "Convert currency with PayPal" to change it to "Convert with card issuer."

If you don't see the option to choose your preferred conversion rate, it means that your card can only use either your card's conversion rate or PayPal's conversion rate.

We only ask you for essential information when you sign up to PayPal, but if you want to hold a balance, we're under a legal obligation to confirm your identity. Even though PayPal isn't a bank, we need to comply with the same government regulations as other financial institutions.

What is Pay in 4?
Pay in 4 is an interest-free instalment product that lets you split your purchase into 4 payments, with the first payment due at the time of purchase and 3 subsequent repayments made every 2 weeks thereafter.

How can I pay with Pay in 4?
If eligible, Pay in 4 will appear as a payment method for shopping cart values between $30 and $1,500 when you check out with PayPal. Upon applying, you'll receive a decision within seconds, although not every application will be approved.

Availability depends on your state of residence, and you must be at least 18 years of age to apply. You must also have a PayPal account in good standing or open a PayPal account to apply.

Pay in 4 is not available for certain merchants and goods. Offer availability depends on the merchant and may not be available for certain recurring subscription services.

Are there terms and conditions for my Pay in 4 loan?
Yes. You must read the loan agreement and other terms and disclosures for your Pay in 4 loan before you submit your application. Your payment schedule is provided within the application process, in a payment summary communication once you are approved and use your loan, and also available in the PayPal app or desktop experience within the plan details of the Pay Later sections. You will see the link to the loan agreement while applying for Pay in 4. You will have the option to download the loan agreement.

Once your plan starts, we will send you an email containing important information about your Pay in 4 loan, including how to locate your loan agreement in your PayPal account.

Are there any fees associated with Pay in 4?
PayPal does not charge any sign-up, application, late, or non-sufficient funds (NSF) fees when you pay for your purchase with Pay in 4. However, if your repayment is returned because of non-sufficient funds or for another reason, your financial institution may charge you an NSF or other fee.

How long will my Pay in 4 plan last?
Your Pay in 4 loan lasts a little over 6 weeks in total. The down payment is due at the time of the transaction and 3 subsequent repayments will be taken by autopay every 2 weeks thereafter.

What currencies are accepted?
Transactions can be made in all currencies that PayPal supports, not just US Dollars (USD). For transactions not in USD, PayPal will automatically convert the transaction amount to USD at checkout before providing you with your Pay in 4 loan. Currency conversion charges will apply and can be found in the PayPal User Agreement.

Why could I use Pay in 4 before but it’s not available with the same merchant now?
Pay in 4 eligibility will vary by merchant and individual shopping experience. The Pay in 4 option will be displayed in PayPal checkout if the option is available for the specific merchant as well as the transaction amount and type. Keep in mind, not all goods and services are eligible. If for some reason the items in your cart are not eligible for Pay in 4, the offer will not be available.

How will my Pay in 4 purchase show in my PayPal activity?
Every purchase made with a Pay in 4 loan will appear in your PayPal activity as a full purchase amount under the merchant’s name. This line item reflects PayPal paying the merchant upfront so you can then pay PayPal back for your Pay in 4 loan by spreading the repayments over time according to your plan's payment schedule. 

You will also see your down payment taken on the day of the purchase which will equal one-fourth of your total purchase amount.

Why was my Pay in 4 approval not used for my completed purchase?
Your Pay in 4 approval is valid for that specific shopping session in which it was granted. If you change the payment method during checkout and don’t switch back to Pay in 4, your purchase will be charged to that changed payment method. In addition, if you experience a disruption in your session (internet glitch or session timeout) the approval may become invalid. In that case, you would need to apply again to use Pay in 4 for a transaction.

Questions about Pay in 4 applications
How is my application for Pay in 4 evaluated?
Our decisioning process is automated and we evaluate information such as the information you provided within your application and information about your usage and history with PayPal. We may also use external bureau data to evaluate your application.

Will applying for Pay in 4 impact my credit score?
No. Applying for Pay in 4 will not impact your credit score. A soft credit check may be needed, but it will not affect your credit score.

Why was my Pay in 4 application declined?
If your application gets declined, you can still use PayPal to check out securely with other payment methods in your wallet. We will send you a message in the PayPal Message Center explaining why your application wasn’t approved.

Our Customer Service team can’t see your decline explanation reason(s) and cannot review loan applications.

If you would like to better understand why you may have been declined and potential ways to increase future eligibility after reviewing your secure message center notification, visit What are some things I can do that impact my Pay Later eligibility?.

I was preapproved so why was my Pay in 4 application declined?
If you received a preapproved loan offer for Pay in 4, you may still be declined if you no longer meet the criteria used to select you or the offer, give info we can’t match, and other reasons. Preapproval is not a guarantee of approval as disclosed in the application process. For privacy reasons, only you can see why your application was declined. We have sent an electronic communication with the details and reasons your application was declined to your PayPal Message Center. 

I see a prequalified amount for Pay in 4, what does that mean?
A Pay in 4 prequalified amount is a total estimate of how much you can spend with Pay in 4 on eligible purchases between $30-$1,500. You only pay back what you borrow. A prequalified amount does not guarantee approval and is not a credit line. You must still apply and be approved for Pay in 4 during checkout.

The prequalified amount may change or even go away as it is based on a number of factors, including but not limited to account status, repayment history, and other factors.

Not all customers will see a Pay in 4 prequalified amount.

My prequalified Pay in 4 amount does not match what I want to spend.
The prequalified amount is an estimate. Your individual Pay in 4 application may be approved for a different amount. You do not have to use the entire prequalified amount shown and you’ll only pay back what you spend.
`,
`
Why is there a pending authorization shown in my PayPal activity for my Pay in 4 transaction?
When making a purchase with Pay in 4, we will conduct a pre-authorization hold on your payment method for an amount equal to the down payment or one-fourth of your total purchase amount. This will show as a pending authorization within your PayPal Account Activity and also at your financial institution.

Once you complete your purchase with Pay in 4 and the merchant completes your order, the pending authorization will be removed, and the down payment will be withdrawn from your specified payment method.

If the merchant does not complete your order within 72 hours, the authorization will be voided and there will be a new authorization for the down payment if the purchase is later completed by the merchant.

If you do not complete your Pay in 4 transaction, the pending authorization will be automatically voided by PayPal within 72 hours of the pre-authorization hold. Although PayPal has released the hold on your funds, this may take up to 5 business days to process through your financial institution or bank.

`
Questions about Single-Use Card
I applied for Pay in 4, was approved, and received a single-use card number, now what?

You can use your single use card number to shop online at most places where Mastercard is accepted and leverage your Pay in 4 loan. Restrictions apply to hotel and airfare, as well as other transactions.

If you applied for Pay in 4 and received a single-use card number, it can be copied and pasted into the credit card field of any online checkout where Mastercard is accepted.  Since approval happens before checkout, your approved Pay in 4 loan amount may be slightly different than the amount you actually spend. You will only ever pay back what you spend. For example, if you applied for $300 and only spend $200, you will make 4 interest-free repayments of $50.
The single-use card number is valid for one purchase and must be used within 24 hours of approval. If you need to re-access your single-use card information, log in to the PayPal app or desktop, tap on the Pay Later tile, and then click on your Pay in 4 plan to view your single-use card information. If it expires before you use it, you will have to apply for a new loan. There’s no impact on your credit score for applying.
If we were unable to approve your application, please check your PayPal Message Center for more details. For privacy reasons, only you can see why your application was declined. Our customer service team cannot see your decline explanation reason(s) and cannot review loan applications.
Why was my single-use card number declined even though my application was approved?
Single-use cards can be declined for the following reasons:

The single-use card has already been used.
The attempted transaction was for an amount greater than the approved Pay in 4 loan amount.
The single-use card number has expired (24 hours after approval).
The single-use card was used for a restricted transaction. Note: single-use cards cannot be used for hotels or airfare at this time.
The item(s) ordered are back ordered.
How do I re-access my single-use card number after I was approved?
Once approved for a single-use card number, it will be available in your PayPal wallet for 24 hours. To access it tap on the home tab, tap the Pay Later tile, and click on your Pay in 4 plan to view your single-use card number information.
`,
`
How does a merchant refund work for my Pay in 4 plan?
Since PayPal paid the merchant for your Pay in 4 purchase, we would attempt to apply the full or partial refund from the merchant to the corresponding Pay in 4 loan.

If the refund satisfies the entire outstanding balance on the Pay in 4 loan, you will not have any further repayment obligations. Please check your Pay in 4 loan details to ensure that the loan balance is marked as Completed. If the refund results in a credit balance refund (an overpayment of the Pay in 4 loan), your credit balance will be moved to your PayPal balance automatically. This can take up to 7 days if any of the repayments are still in process.

If your refund is partial, it will still be applied to your Pay in 4 loan. A partial refund may reduce the number of remaining payments or the amount of your final payment.

If the merchant issues a refund in the form of a store credit, gift card, or cash, your remaining loan balance will still be due to PayPal. This is because PayPal paid the merchant on your behalf when you were approved for a Pay in 4 loan and made your transaction with Pay in 4. Since the merchant refunded you directly, you’ll still owe any remaining balance on the loan.

Sometimes the merchant does not provide PayPal with enough information to identify a specific Pay in 4 plan where the refund should be applied. If this happens, PayPal will refund the amount we receive from the merchant to your linked PayPal balance account or PayPal account. This means that your Pay in 4 plan will not be credited with the refunded amount and will still be due. You are able to use the refunded funds from your PayPal balance account to pay your Pay in 4 plan directly through the PayPal app or website, or you can withdraw the funds to your bank account and then pay your outstanding Pay in 4 amount either though the website, app, or by Contacting Us.
`,
`
Questions about Pay in 4 repayments
How do I make my repayments?
Your down payment is due at the time of transaction, and your 3 subsequent repayments will be taken automatically every 2 weeks from the confirmed payment method you provided at the time of application.

Accepted forms of repayment are bank account, debit card, or credit card (note: Capital One and Chase credit cards cannot be used for repayments on Buy Now Pay Later loans, and other restrictions may apply). Your PayPal balance can only be used for one-time repayments that you initiate through the PayPal app, PayPal website, or with a member of our customer service team. You can’t use your PayPal balance for automatic payments.

Where can I find how much I owe?
Here's how:

Log into your PayPal account.
Go to the Pay Later section.
Click on the specific Pay in 4 plan in reference.  
The amount you still owe will be under "Remaining."

Where can I find the amount of my repayments?
Here’s how:

Log into your PayPal account.
Go to the Pay Later section.
Click on the specific Pay in 4 plan in reference.
There, the amount you have paid will be under “You’ve Paid”. You can also locate the amounts of your previous repayments in your Plan Activity or reference the amounts of upcoming repayments by clicking See Payment Schedule.

Can I make extra or unscheduled repayments?
Yes, here’s how:

Log into your PayPal account.
Go to the Pay Later section.
Click on the specific Pay in 4 plan you want to pay. 
Click Make a Payment.
Then, you can make an unscheduled or extra repayment that will be applied to that Pay in 4 loan.

Important information. If autopay is enabled for your Pay in 4 plan, your extra payment must arrive before 11:59 p.m. ET the day before your due date. Processing a one-time payment after this cut-off time may result in both the one-time repayment and the scheduled auto repayment processing. We can’t cancel or reverse payments once they go through. If this action results in an overpayment of your full Pay in 4 plan amount, the overpayment will be refunded to your PayPal balance within 7 days.

Can I pay off the entire Pay in 4 plan at once?
Yes, here’s how:

Log into your PayPal account.
Go to the Pay Later section.
Click on the specific Pay in 4 plan you want to pay off.
Click Make a Payment.
Then, you can make an unscheduled repayment to pay off the entire Pay in 4 loan. There are no penalty fees for paying off the balance early.

Can I pause or suspend my Pay in 4 repayments?
No. Once you agree to the terms of your Pay in 4 loan and your repayments begin, you cannot pause, suspend, or skip your repayments.

Why didn't my repayment go through?
There are several reasons we may not have been able to complete your repayment, including if there were insufficient funds on your debit card, credit card, or bank account used to make your repayment or if your payment method hasn't been confirmed. Here is how to confirm your payment method.

How can I update my payment method for future repayments?
If you want to make future repayments with a different or updated payment method, you can change your payment method. 

Here's how:

Log into your PayPal account.
Go to the Pay Later section, and click on the specific Pay in 4 plan you want to change.
Click Change under “Payment Method” to update your information or choose a new way to pay. You may need to confirm your new payment method before you can use it for repayments.
If your payment method expires before your Pay in 4 plan ends, you can update your information by following the same steps (above) or update your information in your PayPal wallet by logging into your PayPal account, clicking Wallet, choosing the payment method you want to update and clicking Update.

What if I miss a repayment?
Missing your down payment or a repayment may cause your loan to become past due. If that occurs, the loan will be reflected as past due in the Pay Later section of your account with PayPal, and you may receive an automated phone call and/or other communication, reminding you of your past due balance and informing you of how you can make your repayment.

Missed repayments also may impact future eligibility for Pay Later products.

How long does it take for my latest repayment to appear in my Pay in 4 activity?
Your Activity is updated within 24 hours on the Pay Later section of your PayPal account.

I have opened a dispute, do I still need to make repayments?
Yes. You must continue making repayments when due while we investigate your dispute.

I filed a chargeback with my bank and it was closed in my favor. Why do I still owe money on my Pay in 4 loan?
When you complete a purchase using Pay in 4, PayPal pays the merchant the full amount of the purchase and collects a down payment at the time of the transaction and 3 installments from your payment method of choice over time totaling the amount of the purchase made. When you took out the installment loan from PayPal, you agreed to pay PayPal back the amount of the loan in full.

When you open a chargeback with your financial institution on a repayment made to your PayPal Pay in 4 loan and your financial institution completes the chargeback request on a repayment made to your loan, PayPal returns the funds to your financial institution. This removes the completed repayment from your loan and will cause your Pay in 4 loan to become past due as there no longer is a completed repayment.

If there is an issue with the item ordered, you will want to follow the steps in opening a dispute through PayPal on the full payment that your merchant received (not individual repayments to your loan).

Here is how to open a dispute through PayPal:

Go to the Resolution Center and click Report a Problem. 
Select the original payment to the merchant and click Continue.
Select the reason for your dispute, such as:
Issues with your purchase
Issues with the seller
Billing errors or Issues with subscriptions
Unauthorized activity in your PayPal account
Select the option that best describes the issue you're facing and click Continue.
Should I still make payments if I’m expecting a refund?
Yes, it’s important to continue making repayments according to your payment schedule even if you are expecting a refund.

Once a merchant processes your refund, we’ll apply the refunded amount to your Pay in 4 loan and send you a confirmation email.

If the refunded amount exceeds the outstanding loan balance, the excess money will be applied to your PayPal balance in the form of a credit balance refund automatically. This may take up to 7 days if any of the repayments are still in progress. An additional email confirmation will be sent once we process the overpayment refund.

If the refunded amount does not exceed the outstanding loan balance, you must continue to make your Pay in 4 repayments until the loan is paid in full.

If the merchant issues a refund in the form of a store credit, gift card, or cash, your remaining loan balance will still be due. This is because PayPal paid the merchant on your behalf when you were approved for a Pay in 4 loan. Since the merchant refunded you directly, you’ll still owe any remaining balance on the loan.

Sometimes the merchant does not provide PayPal with enough information to identify a specific Pay in 4 plan where the refund should be applied. If this happens, PayPal will refund the amount we receive from the merchant to your linked PayPal balance account or PayPal account. This means that your Pay in 4 plan will not be credited with the refunded amount and will still be due. You are able to use the refunded funds from your PayPal balance account to pay your Pay in 4 plan directly through the PayPal app or website, or you can withdraw the funds to your bank account and then pay your outstanding Pay in 4 amount either through the website, app or by contacting us.

How do I transfer my crypto?
PayPal supports the transfer of cryptocurrencies between PayPal, Venmo, and other wallets and exchanges. PYUSD can be transferred between PayPal and exchanges that support it. PYUSD can also be sent to most Ethereum and Arbitrum addresses in wallets that support ERC-20 tokens and most Solana addresses in wallets that support SPL tokens.

To send crypto outside of PayPal, you'll need to provide the wallet address where you want to send the crypto. Crypto transfers cannot be cancelled or reversed. Please ensure the recipient’s details are correct. Crypto that is sent to the wrong recipient, wrong address, or via unsupported networks will be lost. We aren’t able to reverse these transactions after they’re complete. For PayPal USD, first, check with your external wallet to confirm they will accept your PYUSD.

Here is how to transfer to an external BTC address or PayPal customer:

Go to the Finances tab.
Tap your crypto balance.
Tap the Transfer arrows Transfer arrows.
Tap Send.
If you want to sync your PayPal contacts so that you can send them crypto, tap Sync Your Contacts.
Tap OK to allow PayPal to access your contacts.
Select the contact you want to send crypto to.
You’ll need to enter an external crypto address if you want to transfer cryptocurrency out of your account.
Copy and paste an address, manually enter it, or scan a QR code by tapping the QR code button to the right of the search box.
If you are sending PYUSD to an external blockchain address, tap Got it on the blockchain network confirmation screen.
Enter the amount you want to send and tap Next.
You can put an exact amount of a cryptocurrency to send if you know it
Or you can enter a dollar amount. We’ll calculate approximately how much crypto is worth the amount you entered and send that amount of crypto. The dollar value of your sent crypto will change over time, so it could be worth more or less by the time the recipient gets it.
Review and tap Send Now.
Here is how to receive a cryptocurrency by sharing your PayPal destination address:

Go to the Finances tab.
Tap your crypto balance.
Tap the Transfer arrows Transfer arrows.
Tap Receive.

What is cryptocurrency?
The following information is for educational purposes only and does not constitute an endorsement of this type of cryptocurrency. Consider seeking tax and financial advice from licensed professionals. The cryptocurrency service is currently available to PayPal Balance accounts and certain eligible US-based business account holders only.

Visit Discover Crypto for more information.

PayPal USD (PYUSD) is a type of cryptocurrency called a stablecoin now available for eligible US PayPal users. Learn more about PYUSD. Terms and conditions apply.

It’s digital
Cryptocurrency is a computer-generated file designed to be a completely digital store of value that isn’t connected to anything tangible in the real world.

It’s like currency
Short for cryptocurrency, many believe crypto could one day be as commonly used as cash and credit. Rather than paper bills, cryptocurrency is counted in digital units or “tokens” that can be purchased and sold in fractions.

It's not regulated
For the time being, cryptocurrencies aren’t regulated by governments or central authorities like federal regulatory agencies because they don’t belong to any nations, organizations, or private. However, to make buying and selling crypto possible on PayPal, we also provide electronic money and payment services, which are regulated. You can learn more about these in the PayPal User Agreement.

It’s a technology
Most cryptocurrencies work on an ecosystem of computer programs running on thousands of devices around the world, known as Blockchain technology. Since many of the most prominent Blockchains are public, the information in these networks is protected using cryptography, or complex computer-generated code. This is what puts the “crypto” in cryptocurrency.

It’s growing
Bitcoin launched in 2009 as the first crypto in the world. Today, there are thousands of cryptos – each 1 offering new possibilities and pathways to wider adoption. The cryptocurrencies available on PayPal are PayPal USD, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin, Solana (SOL), and Chainlink (LINK).

PayPal Cryptocurrency FAQ's
Do I need a separate account or need to sign up for anything?
Everything you need is built into your PayPal account. Once you agree to the crypto terms and conditions, we’ll make sure the required info is up to date and confirmed on your account, and then you’ll be able to buy and sell crypto.

Which cryptocurrencies are supported on PayPal?
Customers in the U.S. and U.S. Territories can transact with the following cryptocurrencies on PayPal: PayPal USD, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Solana (SOL), and Chainlink (LINK.)

Can I set up crypto price alerts?
Yes, you can set up price alerts by clicking on the Bell Icon within your profile to customize a price alert if the value changes by (5) %, (8) %, or (10) %. We’ll send a push notification to your mobile device if the price goes up or down over 24 hours. Be sure you’ve installed the PayPal app and have notifications turned on.

Am I getting the best crypto pricing with PayPal?
Crypto price variation is common across crypto exchanges and happens for several reasons:

Crypto trading volume at a large vs. a smaller exchange with less liquidity can impact price.
Pricing and fee structure at the time of purchase is set by the exchange/service, which can also vary.
Price "spreads" might impact the purchase price.
It's important to understand pricing before making any purchases, and we can’t guarantee our rate.

Can you explain the concept of a price "spread"?
Price spreads are the difference between the highest buy order and the lowest sell order on any exchange. Every purchase or sale of crypto occurs in a marketplace, and between 2 entities. The person buying wants the lowest price, and the person selling wants to get the highest price at any point.

This can create a gap in their expectations, known as a spread. Depending on the situation, spreads can lead to increased price volatility and price variation amongst crypto exchanges.

Why can't I access my account everywhere?
Access to the PayPal system from certain locations is not authorized. Please be assured that this has no negative impact on your account. We recommend that you attempt to access your account from the country in which you registered your PayPal account, or from one of the more than 200 countries/regions in which PayPal is available.

Crypto on PayPal: Understanding Total Return & Purchase Price
The information provided by PayPal is not intended to be and should not be construed as tax advice. You should consult your tax adviser regarding which cost-basis method is appropriate for your specific situation.

Total Return
PayPal reflects your crypto balance position with real-time returns based on current market conditions. This is reflected within the Crypto section of your PayPal account.

We calculate Total Return by finding the difference between the original purchase price of your crypto including fees, and the price it’s selling for right now.

What is the purchase price?
Purchase Price refers to the price you originally paid for your crypto, including fees. Entering a purchase price is optional- to show you more precise returns. If left blank, we’ll automatically use the price of the crypto at the time you receive it.

Note that we won't use your manually entered purchase price for tax reporting.

`
Crypto on PayPal: Fees and Exchange Rates
Are there any fees using Crypto with PayPal?
When you buy or sell cryptocurrency on PayPal, we'll disclose an exchange rate and the transaction fee you'll be charged for that transaction.

For PayPal USD only, there are no fees to buy or sell. However, fees apply when you convert between PYUSD and one of the other cryptocurrencies we support.

If you use a linked bank account or debit card as a payment method to buy crypto assets, your bank may charge you its own fees, including overdraft or insufficient fund fees where applicable. PayPal isn’t responsible for any fees that may be charged to you by your bank.

Why is there an exchange rate for cryptocurrency?
Since crypto is digital money, you're essentially swapping one currency for another when you buy and sell it. The exchange rate tells you how much crypto or other currency you'll get in the swap. Please keep in mind that exchange rates refresh often as the value of crypto is constantly changing.

Using PayPal as a payment method within your external crypto wallet
To buy or sell crypto from your external crypto wallet with PayPal:

Log into the crypto-offering mobile app.
Tap Buy or Sell, then select ‘PayPal.’
Enter the USD amount worth of crypto you want to buy or sell. You’ll be redirected to PayPal to log in.
What is a supported external crypto wallet?
It’s a non-PayPal crypto wallet that allows you to buy, sell, or transfer crypto using PayPal.

What external crypto wallets are currently available?
We are rolling out new offerings of supported external crypto wallets to eligible US customers in the coming months.

Currently available supported external crypto wallets:

MetaMask
Magic 
Phantom
Ledger
TastyCrypto
Exodus
In the coming months, more external crypto wallets will be supported for eligible US customers.

What are the PayPal fees for buying crypto in an external crypto wallet with PayPal?
When you buy crypto, you’ll also buy the crypto required to cover the network fee, payable in the cryptocurrency you transfer. The cryptocurrency amount to be transferred to an external wallet plus the crypto amount to cover the cryptocurrency network fee is the “combined cryptocurrency purchase amount.”

For cryptocurrency other than PYUSD, you will pay (1) the transaction fee listed in the “Buying or selling a cryptocurrency” section above on the U.S. dollar value of the combined cryptocurrency purchase amount and (2) 1% only on the U.S. dollar value of the cryptocurrency that you transfer to your external wallet.

For PYUSD, you will pay 1.5% on the U.S. dollar value of the PYUSD that you transfer to your external wallet. You will not pay a transaction fee on the combined cryptocurrency purchase amount.

Learn about the exchange rate and cryptocurrency fees.

What cryptocurrencies can I send to supported external crypto wallets?
You can send BTC, ETH, BTH, and LTC to external crypto wallets. PYUSD is available on MetaMask, with more external crypto wallets being supported for eligible US customers in the coming weeks.

What are the PayPal buying limits in an external crypto wallet?
We have a $25,000 USD/week sending limit and a $100,000 USD/week buying limit. The limit for using PayPal to buy and transfer crypto in one step to an external crypto wallet is the lower of these 2 limits.

What funding sources am I able to use?
Customers can use their PayPal balance, bank, and debit card to buy crypto. Customers will not be able to use a credit card.

Can I use crypto in my PayPal Hub to buy crypto in an external wallet?
You can send crypto from your PayPal Crypto Hub to an external crypto wallet and buy and send crypto to the external crypto wallet. But customers aren't able to use the combination of both methods in a single transaction. 

Will the crypto bought or sold be held, or is it instant?
As with all transactions, your ability to buy, sell, or transfer crypto assets may be delayed or unavailable if there is an issue.

Receiving crypto into PayPal
Once you’ve completed verification:

Select receive in the crypto hub in your PayPal account.
Choose a cryptocurrency type, for example, Bitcoin, to generate a crypto address.
Use the crypto address to send crypto from an external crypto wallet. (A new address is automatically generated for every transfer.)
Remember that this address will only work for the cryptocurrency you choose. Crypto sent to the wrong address type (for example, Bitcoin Cash sent to a Bitcoin address) will be lost.

Sending crypto out of PayPal
To enable external transfers, you’ll need to go through an additional level of account verification. Once enabled, all you need is an external crypto address to transfer cryptocurrency out of PayPal.

Be sure that you enter an address for the exact cryptocurrency you want to send. Crypto sent to the wrong address type (for example, BTC versus BCH) will be lost.

PYUSD can also be sent to most Ethereum addresses in wallets that support ERC-20 tokens and most Solana addresses in wallets that support SPL tokens. For PayPal USD, first, check with your external wallet to confirm they will accept your PYUSD.

Crypto transfers can’t be canceled
Because of the irreversible nature of cryptocurrency protocols, transactions can't be canceled or reversed once initiated. If you sent cryptocurrency to the wrong external crypto address, please contact the recipient and ask for their cooperation in returning it. If you don’t know the owner of the address, there are no actions you can take to get your crypto returned.

If you sent cryptocurrency to the wrong PayPal account holder, please contact the recipient and ask them to return it. Any crypto transferred to another PayPal account that hasn’t been claimed by the recipient after 30 days is automatically reversed to the sender.

Network
A cryptocurrency network refers to the specific blockchain that hosts a digital asset. For instance, the Ethereum token operates on the Ethereum blockchain. Some cryptocurrencies available on PayPal, such PayPal USD (PYUSD), are supported across multiple blockchains, allowing users to select their preferred network for deposits and withdrawals.

These networks may offer different benefits, such as lower fees or faster settlement times. Ethereum’s network offers Layer 2s, which can allow higher capacity and lower costs. Learn more about Layer 2 Crypto Transfers.

Some networks require additional information to process transfers correctly (e.g. memos on Stellar network), and some networks may not be available in certain regions due to regulatory requirements.
When you send or receive PYUSD using PayPal or an external wallet, you’ll have the option to select from supported networks during the transaction process.

Important: Always make sure both you and the other party are using the same network for the transfer. Sending assets to an incompatible address or network can result in a loss of funds.

Sending crypto outside of PayPal will incur a network fee, also known as the blockchain network fee. It isn’t a PayPal transaction fee. The fee may fluctuate depending on network congestion. We will show you the amount you will pay for network fees when you send your crypto and add it to the amount of cryptocurrency you want to send.

Visit our fees page for more information.

Crypto transfer timeframes
Transfers into or out of PayPal on the blockchain usually take around 2 hours to be completed, but this time may fluctuate depending on the type of crypto chosen and network congestion.

When sending crypto to another PayPal Balance account, if your recipient isn’t set up to get crypto in their PayPal Balance account, they’ll have 30 days to get set up and accept your transfer.

Weekly crypto transfer limit

In the US, the maximum amount for weekly cryptocurrency transfers is $25,000 for both internal and external transfers. For more information, please refer to the Transaction Limits section in our Terms and Conditions.

Additional info
After completion, blockchain-based transfers will have a transaction hash (txHash) that is displayed within the activity details. This identifier can be used to look up additional details in any compatible blockchain explorer.

PayPal Purchase Protection
PayPal Purchase Protection doesn’t apply to any transactions in your crypto hub, including purchases, sales, or transfers.

Crypto transfers can fail
Transfers can fail for many reasons, including issues with the cryptocurrency network, system downtime, or issues unique to your account. PayPal does not own or control cryptocurrency networks. If you are trying to send crypto, PayPal will not treat a transfer of Crypto Assets as complete until the transfer is confirmed by the network. A transfer that is never confirmed by the network will show as failed.

When crypto is sent to you, PayPal needs several confirmations on the blockchain to accept the incoming crypto. The number of confirmations depends on the type of cryptocurrency you are trying to receive. You can check the status of your incoming transfer on any publicly available blockchain viewer.

Do I have to pay Taxes on my crypto?
Tax reporting can be daunting, but PayPal is on a mission to make reporting cryptocurrency taxes as seamless as possible.

Information provided by PayPal is not intended to be and should not be construed as tax advice. For questions about your specific tax situation, please consult a tax professional. 

Am I required to file taxes on my crypto?
Starting in 2020, the IRS added a question to the personal federal income tax form (1040) asking taxpayers, “At any time during the tax year, did you receive, sell, send, exchange, or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?”

When answered “Yes,” the IRS would look for a Form 8949 filed by the taxpayer to report capital gain/loss for virtual currency transactions.

How do I file my crypto taxes?
PayPal provides its users with supplemental materials, including a year-end gain/loss statement detailing all taxable dispositions for the year. These documents detail the transaction-level activity you can use to complete your IRS 8949, which includes the date acquired, date disposed of, cost basis (included for user convenience), proceeds, and the resulting gain or loss.

If you have crypto assets outside of PayPal’s platform and subsequently disposed of the assets, PayPal will not have visibility into your information, and it is, therefore, your responsibility to track and report such information.

The invention of Bitcoin has led to thousands of variations on the original - collectively called altcoins - all striving towards the goal of universal adoption.

Why is my cryptocurrency sale on hold? 
Why is my payment on hold or unavailable?
 Your crypto sale/crypto sale proceeds may be on hold due to the unique activity profile of your account. PayPal holds funds for a variety of reasons based on the activity of the account.

Check your account for specific reasons as to why we are holding your money and to learn how you can release it.

Is there a hold when I sell my cryptocurrency?  
If you buy cryptocurrencies but we have not yet received the cleared purchase funds from you, we are entitled to retain the proceeds of any sale by you of your cryptocurrencies pending our receipt of those cleared purchase funds.

We may place a temporary hold on these funds while they are pending (note the hold may not be released if we do not receive cleared purchase funds or if there is another issue with the payment or the account). As with all transactions, crypto sales are subject to review and could be delayed or stopped if there is an issue.

Why are the payments for the sale of cryptocurrency placed on hold?
Holds can be placed on a cryptocurrency sell transaction during a bank transfer (or where another issue with the payment or the account is identified). When the cryptocurrency sale is on hold during a bank transfer, the funds being transferred from your bank have not cleared in the original purchasing transaction. The temporary hold on the funds will be released upon the outstanding amount clearing.

Keep in mind that not all sell transactions will be put on hold. A hold may not be released if the payment transferred from your bank does not clear or if another issue with the payment or the account is identified.

How long will the sell transaction (payment) be on hold?
The hold time will vary depending on several risk factors, such as the amount waiting to be cleared from the bank transfer, and can generally take up to 8 days.

Will future transactions be held?
We cannot say with 100% certainty that no holds will be placed in the future, but if your account is in good standing then there is usually no reason for us to raise any concerns about your account.

Why is my withdrawal from PayPal on hold?
To provide a safe online payment service our internal security system reviews every transaction before it is released. Usually, withdrawals can take anywhere from 2-72 hrs to complete through our system. Generally, they'll complete within 2 hours; however, we occasionally hold a withdrawal, for further review. 

These reviews of withdrawals can happen for various reasons. For example, you may have received an amount of money that is larger than usual for your account, you may be logging in from an unsecured network or you may have made changes to your account Settings recently.

Once we have finished our review your withdrawal will show as ‘completed’ and will be processed to your bank account, providing that the review did not turn up any issues. Withdrawals to bank accounts can take up to 8 working days depending upon your bank's processing time

PayPal USD (PYUSD) is a type of cryptocurrency called a stablecoin now available for eligible US PayPal users. Learn more about PYUSD. Terms and conditions apply.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was created to be an alternative to Bitcoin, something for everyday transactions if crypto becomes widely accepted as a currency.  

The number of transactions that can be processed every second is an important measuring stick. For example, Visa credit cards process around 2000 transactions per second and is capable of handling a lot more. Bitcoin maxes out at about 7 transactions per second. This rate is fine if crypto is only ever going to be used infrequently to buy something like a car, but not if it needs to be flexible enough to also pay for an Uber or get groceries.  

Bitcoin Cash, with the capacity to support more than 100 transactions per second, is helping to show that crypto could one day be a viable option even at the checkout line.

Quick facts    

Bitcoin Cash is a "hard fork", or branching off, of Bitcoin that eventually became its own separate crypto due to philosophical differences about the purpose of Bitcoin.  

While Bitcoin can process about 7 transactions per second, Bitcoin Cash can support more than 100 transactions per second.

What is a Blockchain?
The following information is for educational purposes only and does not constitute an endorsement of this type of cryptocurrency. Consider seeking tax and financial advice from licensed professionals. The cryptocurrency service is currently available to PayPal Balance accounts and certain eligible US-based business account holders only.

Blockchain is the underlying technology that powers each crypto. Blockchain is essential to making crypto work as a virtual currency. Since crypto is a digital asset, or computer-generated file, anyone can make it and replicate it. Blockchain provides the digital record to verify things like whether the sender has enough bitcoins for a transaction, or to make sure the same bitcoins aren't being spent twice.

At its most simple, you can think of the blockchain as a shared ledger that records every time someone sends or receives a crypto coin.

It has a security system    

Blockchains store data using very complex math, or "encryption," which makes it nearly impossible to corrupt or change the transaction records.    

It's decentralized    

Each blockchain runs simultaneously on a network of multiple computers around the world rather than just one central computer.   

Direct peer-to-peer payments    

Typically, you'd use a bank, or other central authority, to conduct and authorize a transaction. But blockchain lets you pay or get paid directly.    

Future potential    

Blockchains can be used to store or send any digital asset, whether that's bitcoins or the next great novel saved on a Microsoft Word file. As you can imagine, blockchains could change how we vote, manage medical records, buy homes, or even track where our food comes from in the future. Crypto is just the beginning.

Ethereum expanded the possibilities of blockchain, the groundbreaking tech behind Bitcoin that supports crypto transactions. The innovation of the Ethereum Blockchain is that it supports the building and execution of apps. Not like TikTok or Instagram, but rather apps made to move things like crypto or anything else that exists in a digital format.

Like other cryptos, Ethereum can be described in terms of its blockchain and its virtual currency, which is called "ether." Ether is valued for its purpose in the Ethereum Blockchain, where it is used to pay for the execution of apps. Think of Ethereum as an engine and ether as its fuel.

What if you could purchase your first home without having to deal with reams of complicated paperwork? Imagine if there was a digital alternative that could process sensitive documents discretely and record the direct transfer of ownership between buyers and sellers - all without the help of any intermediaries. The idea with Ethereum is that there can be an app for that.

Creating apps for Ethereum can be complex, requiring special software and computer programming experience. Many people buy Ethereum without any intent to build apps because they believe in the possibilities of the technology.

Quick facts

Ethereum can also support the creation of new cryptocurrencies.
Ethereum has no supply limit, unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Litecoin

What is the Cryptocurrency vocabulary glossary?
The world of Crypto has its own specialized vocabulary. Here's a few commonly used terms to get you started.

Altcoin - Any of the thousands of cryptocurrencies developed after Bitcoin.
Example: I have a portfolio full of altcoins, but I don 't own any Bitcoin.

Bitcoin - Created to be a new kind of virtual currency that could be sent directly from one person to another, across all borders and without the help of intermediaries like banks.

Crypto - Common abbreviation for cryptocurrency.
Example: The first crypto I bought was Bitcoin but now I own other cryptos like Ethereum.

Decentralized - A system that runs simultaneously on multiple computers in multiple locations, rather than one central computer.
Example: The decentralized technology behind Bitcoin, called blockchain, runs simultaneously on thousands of computers around the world.

Ethereum - Like other cryptos, Ethereum can be described in terms of its blockchain and its virtual currency, which is called "ether." Ether is valued for its purpose in the Ethereum Blockchain, where it is used to pay for the execution of apps. Think of Ethereum as an engine and ether as its fuel.

Fiat Money - is legal tender issued by a government that does not have intrinsic value, such as the US dollar or the Euro.

Fork - Changes to an existing crypto that can result in the creation of a new Crypto.
Example: Bitcoin Cash forked off of Bitcoin and became its own cryptocurrency.

Halving - A built-in defense against inflation that occurs periodically to slow down the production of a cryptocurrency.
Example: Bitcoin and Litecoin have experienced a halving event just about every four years.

Hodl - Intentional misspelling of the word "hold," the practices of keeping; refers to keeping crypto for a long time, regardless of market changes.
Example: My sister believes in Bitcoin so much that she 'd hodl it even if it wasn't worth anything.

Layer 2 transfers- Layer 2 is basically like adding an additional lane to the crypto network highway, increasing its capacity and improving traffic flow. They are essentially protocols built on top of Ethereum to process transactions more efficiently and cost-effectively. By utilizing Layer 2 solutions, we can significantly increase the number of transactions that can be processed on the Ethereum network, reduce fees, and increase transaction speed. Learn more about Layer 2 Crypto Transfers.

Litecoin - One of the earliest "altcoins", it was designed to be cheaper to use and have faster transaction confirmation.

Mining - Process for producing units of a cryptocurrency. Like mining for gold, but instead of pickaxes, crypto miners use powerful computers to solve difficult math problems.
Example: I 've been mining Ethereum for a year and only have 2 ether. I think I need a better computer.

Network- A cryptocurrency network refers to the specific blockchain that hosts a digital asset. For instance, the Ethereum token operates on the Ethereum blockchain. Some cryptocurrencies available on PayPal, such PayPal USD (PYUSD), are supported across multiple blockchains, allowing users to select their preferred network for deposits and withdrawals. These networks may offer different benefits, such as lower fees or faster settlement times. Some require additional information to process transfers correctly.

Important: They user should always make sure both parties are using the same network for the transfer. Sending assets to an incompatible address or network can result in loss of funds.

Stablecoin - Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to the price of another asset, such as currency or a commodity.

Volatility - How quickly and how much the value of crypto changes. Volatility can indicate risk.
Example: Bitcoin was really volatile yesterday. The price went down at breakfast and went back up by lunch.

Whale - Someone who owns a very large amount of crypto and can potentially affect the market through their decisions to buy, hold, and sell.
Example: Wonder how things will be after that whale in Switzerland bought a bunch of Bitcoin Cash.

Why can't I pay with PayPal Credit Card or PayPal Credit digital line?
Here are some common reasons why you may be unable to pay with your PayPal Credit Card or PayPal Credit digital line, and what you can do:

Your purchase attempt might exceed your available credit.

If you made a payment toward your balance to increase your available credit, check your balance to make sure that the payment has posted to your account. It may take several business days for the available credit to reflect the amount of your payment. 
If you paid and the seller hasn’t processed the transaction, it may impact your available credit. If you wish to cancel a pending order like this, please contact the seller. Once canceled, it should be removed from your account within 30 days. If a canceled pending order is still on your account and you believe it's causing your later purchase attempt to be declined, call the number on the back of your statement for assistance.

Is the phone number the same one we have on your PayPal account?

`
What is Pay Monthly?
Pay Monthly is a way to spread the cost of qualifying purchases between $49 - $10,000 USD into fixed monthly payments over terms ranging from 3 to 24 months, available to eligible customers during online checkout. Terms and rates vary based on purchase amount and your credit.

Pay Monthly is an interest-bearing installment loan issued by PayPal’s bank partner, WebBank, with a fixed APR ranging from 9.99% - 35.99 % based on creditworthiness. Lower APRs may be offered as a promotion from time to time and are subject to eligibility and the terms of the offer.

Pay Monthly isn’t available for certain merchants & goods and may not be available for subscriptions or recurring payments. New and existing PayPal customers can take advantage of Pay Monthly (eligibility varies by user, state, merchant, etc.).

How can I pay with Pay Monthly?
If eligible, Pay Monthly is available to PayPal customers online at checkout for millions of merchants where PayPal is accepted and is subject to consumer credit approval. Eligibility varies and availability depends on your state of residence. You must also be at least 18 years of age (or the age of majority in your state) to apply and have a PayPal account in good standing (or open a PayPal account) to apply.

Pay Monthly can be used only for a single purchase transaction. Each time you wish to use Pay Monthly to finance a transaction, you must apply for a new Pay Monthly installment loan.

You'll be taken through the application process if you choose it as your payment method when you check out. You’ll receive a decision within seconds, but not every application will be approved. Eligibility will vary from merchant to merchant and purchase to purchase.

What are the terms of my Pay Monthly installment loan?
Once approved, you will be shown a WebBank Truth in Lending Disclosure Statement and Pay Monthly Loan Agreement detailing the terms of your Pay Monthly installment loan, including the APR, estimated monthly payment schedule, and other important terms.
The first loan payment is due one month after the merchant processes your order. Your Loan Agreement will reflect a payment schedule based on your order being processed the same day your loan is approved. If processing takes longer than that and the payment schedule changes after the Loan Agreement is provided, an updated payment schedule is sent via email. Please note that you cannot change your payment due dates.
Payments can be made manually or through autopay using a confirmed bank account (ACH) or debit card. Your PayPal balance can only be used for manual repayments. Credit cards aren’t accepted as a repayment option.
Pay Monthly installment loans aren’t recommended on backordered items.
Multiple Pay Monthly installment loans are allowed subject to eligibility and approval.
How is my Pay Monthly payment calculated?
Payments include both principal and interest and are payable as fixed monthly installments across the term of your loan according to the payment schedule that was provided to you.

Where can I view my Pay Monthly installment loan details?
You can find them in the PayPal App by clicking Pay Later or on your desktop by clicking Pay Later under the “Wallet” section. There, you can view the balance, payment schedule, and transaction details. You can also make payments, set up autopay, change your payment method used for payments, and more.

What if my Pay Monthly purchase contains multiple items and the merchant processes/ ships items at different times?
Merchants sometimes process and/or ship your order in multiple packages at different times. They usually ship as soon as products/merchandise are ready versus holding the entire order while waiting on the full order to be prepared. Your Pay Monthly installment loan won’t start accruing interest until the first item is processed and/or shipped. This item will appear in your PayPal Activity and the outstanding balance of your Pay Monthly installment loan will be equal to this amount.

If additional items are processed and/or shipped at a later time, each item will be listed in your PayPal Activity, and your loan’s outstanding balance will be updated accordingly. If this impacts your outstanding loan balance and monthly payment amount, you will be sent an updated payment schedule via email and you will see the changes when you access your Pay Monthly loan in the PayPal app or online.

Why was my Pay Monthly approval not used for my completed purchase?
Your approved Pay Monthly loan is valid for that specific shopping session in which it was granted. If you change the payment method during checkout and don’t switch back to Pay Monthly, your purchase will be charged to that changed payment method. In addition, if you experience a disruption in your session (internet glitch or session timeout) the approval may become invalid. In that case you would need to re-apply to use Pay Monthly for a transaction.
`,
`
Are there any fees for using Pay Monthly?
No, however, late or missed payments may be reported to the credit bureaus and you may be charged a returned payment, NSF, or other fee by your financial institution if the payment fails.
`,
`
Questions about Pay Monthly Applications
How do I apply for Pay Monthly?
To apply, you’ll need to create a PayPal account (if you don’t already have one) and complete the Pay Monthly installment loan application by entering and/or confirming your personal information, including your US residential address, phone number/type, date of birth, your Social Security Number (SSN) or Individual Tax Identification Number (ITIN), and annual income after taxes.

This information is used to verify identity and determine eligibility.

How is my Pay Monthly application assessed?
When applications are reviewed, several factors are considered including, but not limited to, the information you provided in your application, your credit score, your transaction history with PayPal, and how long you've had a PayPal account.

Eligibility criteria are subject to change based on various factors.

Why was my Pay Monthly application declined?
If your Pay Monthly application can’t be approved, you can still use PayPal to check out securely with other payment methods in your Wallet. Please look for the details on the application decision in a secure message on your PayPal account message center.

Our Customer Service team can’t see your decline reason(s) and can’t review loan applications.

If you would like to better understand why you may have been declined and potential ways to increase future eligibility after reviewing your secure message center, visit What are some things I can do that impact my Pay Later eligibility?

Does applying for Pay Monthly impact my credit score?
Applying for Pay Monthly will not impact your credit score. If your Pay Monthly installment loan is approved and used, PayPal may report your Pay Monthly installment loan to credit reporting agencies. This will include information like your loan amount and payment history, which may impact your credit score.
`,
`
How does my Pay Monthly payment appear on my financial institution’s debit or bank statement?

Questions about Pay Monthly Repayments
How do I make my Pay Monthly payment?
You can make one-time payments on your loan using your PayPal balance, a debit card, or a confirmed bank account in your PayPal Wallet. Payments can be made online, through the PayPal app or PayPal.com, with a specialist over the phone, or by setting up autopay. You cannot change the due dates for your Pay Monthly installment loan. Note: Each loan must be paid individually. 


How do I enable or disable autopay for my active Pay Monthly plan?
Here’s how to enable autopay:

Log in to your PayPal account.
Select the Pay Monthly plan.
Click the Toggle to the right of "Autopay".
Select the payment method you would like to use for repayments.
Click Confirm.
Click Done.
Here’s how to disable Autopay:

Log in to your PayPal account.
Select the Pay Monthly plan.
Click the Toggle to the right of "Autopay".
Click Confirm Autopay Off.
Click Done.
Where can I find out how much I owe?
Here’s how:

Log into your PayPal account.
Go to the Pay Later section.
Click on the specific Pay Monthly loan in reference.
The amount you still owe will be under “Remaining.”

Where can I find the amount of my repayments?
Here’s how:

Log into your PayPal account.
Go to the Pay Later section.
Click on the specific Pay Monthly loan in reference.
There you can locate the amounts of your previous repayments under “You’ve paid”. You can also reference the amounts of upcoming repayments by clicking See Payment Schedule.

Can I pay off my Pay Monthly installment loan early without penalty?
Yes, you can view your Pay Monthly remaining balance in the PayPal app by clicking Pay Later and selecting your Pay Monthly loan. There you can make additional payments as desired or pay off the loan in full at any time and you won’t be charged a fee or penalty if you do so. Paying the loan off early may lower the total amount of interest you pay.

Here’s how to make an extra or unscheduled repayment:

Log into your PayPal account.
Go to the Pay Later section.
Click on the specific Pay Monthly loan you want to repay.
Click Make a Payment.
There, you can make an unscheduled or extra repayment that will be applied to that Pay Monthly loan.

Important information. If autopay is enabled for your Pay Monthly plan, the one-time repayment has to be received prior to 11:59 pm ET the day before your repayment due date in order to stop the auto repayment from processing. Processing a one-time payment after this cut-off time may result in both the one-time repayment and the scheduled auto repayment processing. We are unable to return payments. If this action results in an overpayment of your full Pay Monthly plan amount, the overpayment will be refunded to your PayPal balance.

Why wasn't my Pay Monthly payment successful?
There are several reasons we may not have been able to complete your scheduled or one-time payment, including if there is insufficient money in your bank account or debit card.

You’ll receive a notice that your payment wasn’t successful. Please update the payment information as quickly as possible as we may attempt to process the payment again.

Can I change the payment method for Pay Monthly payments?
Yes. You can update your payment method to another confirmed bank account (ACH) or debit card available in your PayPal Wallet. If you change a payment method in your PayPal Wallet and you are set up on autopay, make sure you re-select the new payment method for your Pay Monthly loan. This won’t happen automatically.

For one-time payments, you can use any confirmed bank account (ACH), debit card, or use the balance in your PayPal Balance account.

Credit cards and prepaid cards are not accepted as repayment options.

How can I update my payment method for automatic repayments?
If you want to make future automatic repayments with a different or updated payment method, you can change your payment method:

Log into your PayPal account.
Go to the Pay Later section.
Click on the specific Pay Monthly loan you want to change.
Click Change under “Autopay” to update your information or choose a new way to pay. You may need to confirm your new payment method before you can use it for repayments.
If your payment method expires before your Pay Monthly loan ends, you can update your information by following the same steps (above) or update your information in your PayPal Wallet by logging into your PayPal account, clicking Wallet, choosing the payment method you want to update and clicking Update.

What happens if I miss a Pay Monthly payment?
Any missed payment amount will be added to the next monthly payment due. The next monthly payment will also be considered late if the full amount due isn't paid. Missed payments may be reported to the credit reporting agencies.

If my Pay Monthly payments fall past due, when is my loan charged off?
If your loan reaches 120 days past due, it may be charged off and may be reported to the credit reporting agencies.

What if I make a Pay Monthly payment by mistake?
Any amount paid in excess of the payment amount due will be applied to your outstanding loan balance. Any amount paid in excess of your outstanding loan balance will be a credit on your Pay Monthly account and will be automatically refunded to your PayPal Balance within 7 days.

What happens if I pay more than my next Pay Monthly payment due?
Any amount paid in excess of the payment amount due will be automatically applied to your outstanding loan balance.

Can I make one payment for multiple Pay Monthly loans?
No. Each loan must be paid individually.
`,
`
Can I change the payment method for Pay Monthly payments?
Yes. You can update your payment method to another confirmed bank account (ACH) or debit card available in your Wallet. If you change your payment method in your PayPal Wallet and you are set up on autopay, make sure you re-select the new payment method for your Pay Monthly loan. This won’t happen automatically.

`,
`
Questions about Pay Monthly Disputes, Merchant Refunds
I returned items bought using Pay Monthly to the merchant; now what?

Please continue to make payments to keep your loan in good standing until the merchant processes your return.

After the merchant processes your return, they’ll send a refund to PayPal for the amount equal to the returned items. At that point, PayPal will apply that amount to your Pay Monthly installment loan and send you a confirmation email.

If the amount returned exceeds the outstanding balance on the loan, the excess money will be applied to your PayPal Balance automatically in the form of a credit balance refund. This could take up to 7 days if any of the repayments are still in progress. An additional email confirmation will be sent once we process the overpayment refund. 

Sometimes, the merchant does not provide us with enough information so that we can identify a specific Pay Monthly Loan. If this happens, we will refund the amount we receive from the merchant to your PayPal Balance. This means your Pay Monthly loan will not be credited with the refunded amount or any interest that accrued on that amount. You will remain responsible for repaying your loan in accordance with its terms. You can find your payment schedule and a copy of your Loan Agreement by logging into your PayPal account, clicking the Pay Later Hub, and accessing the Pay Monthly loan. 

For more details about how full and partial refunds are allocated to your loan, please refer to your Pay Monthly Loan Agreement.
`,
`
Do I still get PayPal Purchase Protection when I choose Pay Monthly?
Yes. PayPal Purchase Protection applies to eligible purchases made with Pay Monthly. If you don't receive your item or it's significantly not as described, you may qualify for Purchase Protection, and we'll reimburse you for the full purchase price plus any original shipping costs, subject to terms and limitations.

I have opened a dispute, do I still need to make repayments?
Yes. You must continue making repayments when due while we investigate your dispute.

I filed a chargeback with my bank and it was closed in my favor. Why do I still owe money on my Pay Monthly loan?
When you complete a purchase using Pay Monthly, PayPal, on behalf of WebBank, pays the merchant the full amount of the purchase and collects payments monthly from your payment method of choice over time totaling the amount of the purchase plus interest according to the terms of your Pay Monthly loan. When you took out the installment loan from PayPal, you agreed to pay PayPal back the amount of the loan in full.

When you open a chargeback with your bank or financial institution on a repayment made to your PayPal Pay Monthly loan, PayPal returns the funds to your bank or financial institution. This removes the completed repayment from your loan and will cause your Pay Monthly loan to become past-due as there no longer is a completed repayment.

If there is an issue with the item ordered, you will want to follow the steps for opening a dispute through PayPal on the full payment that your merchant received (not individual repayments to your loan).

Here is how to open a dispute through PayPal:

Go to the Resolution Center and click Report a Problem.
Select the original payment to the merchant and click Continue.
Select the reason for your dispute, such as:
Issues with your purchase
Issues with the seller
Billing errors or Issues with subscriptions
Unauthorized activity in your PayPal account
Select the option that best describes the issue you're facing and click Continue.
`,
`
Should I still make Pay Monthly payments if I’m expecting a refund?
Yes. It’s important to keep your loan current and to continue making payments according to your payment schedule until the merchant processes the refund.

After the merchant processes your refund, we’ll apply the refunded amount to your Pay Monthly installment loan. If the refunded amount exceeds the outstanding balance on the loan, the excess money will be applied to your PayPal balance. We’ll notify you via email that the refund has been processed and applied to your Pay Monthly installment loan. If a credit balance refund is due to you, we’ll notify you via email when the refund is made.
`,
`
Will my Pay Monthly payments be the same after my dispute case is closed?
It depends on how the case is resolved. If the dispute is resolved in your favor, the disputed amount reduces the Pay Monthly outstanding balance. If there’s a loan balance remaining, you’re responsible for repaying that balance according to its existing payment schedule.

If the dispute is resolved in the merchant’s favor, you’re responsible for repaying your Pay Monthly loan in accordance with your Loan Agreement and existing payment schedule.
`,
`
Do I still need to make payments if I have an open dispute on a transaction funded by Pay Monthly?
Yes, payments will still need to be made on the Pay Monthly Installment loan while the dispute is in process. Please continue to check your Pay Monthly installment loan’s payment schedule to see when payments are required.

If the dispute is resolved in your favor, the disputed amount reduces the Pay Monthly outstanding balance. Any amount paid in excess of your outstanding loan balance will be a credit on your Pay Monthly account and will be refunded to your PayPal Balance account if you have one, or to your PayPal account if you do not have a PayPal Balance account.

If a dispute is resolved in the merchant’s favor, future payments are expected to continue as stated in your existing payment schedule or the updated payment schedule provided to you after the dispute is resolved via email (if applicable).

What is a passkey and how do I use it to log in to my PayPal account?
What are passkeys?
Passkeys are a simple and secure alternative to passwords. With a passkey, you can log in to PayPal using the same biometrics, PIN, or password you use to unlock your device.

Why are passkeys safer than passwords?  
Unlike passwords, passkeys can only exist on your devices. They can't be written down or accidentally be given to a bad actor. When you use a passkey to sign in to your PayPal account, it proves to PayPal that you have access to your device and are able to unlock it.

With passkeys, does PayPal now have my biometric data? 
No. Your biometric data is not shared with PayPal and never leaves your device. 

What happens if my device is lost or stolen? 
If your device is lost or stolen, you can still log in to PayPal with your password or a one-time passcode.

Your PayPal account on the lost or stolen device cannot be accessed using the saved passkey without your face, fingerprint or PIN. As an extra precaution, you can also remove the passkey associated with the lost or stolen device.

What does my device need to setup a passkey with PayPal?
Passkeys are currently available for the following eligible Personal accounts: 

iOS 16 or higher
PayPal app
Safari version 16.1 or higher
Chrome version 108 or higher
MacOS Ventura or higher
Safari version 16.1 or higher
Chrome version 118 or higher
Windows 10 or higher
Edge version 108 or higher
Chrome version 108 or higher
Android 9 or higher
PayPal app
Chrome version 108 or higher
How do I create and review a passkey?
To create a passkey, go to the Passkey Creation page (you may be asked to log in), and follow the on-screen prompts.

To review your passkey, go to the Passkey Management page (you may be asked to log in). You can review your existing passkeys on this page.

How do I delete my passkey?
Once you set up a passkey, it is saved in your password manager (for example, iCloud keychain or Google Password Manager). If you wish to remove your passkey so it can no longer be used to sign in to PayPal on your device, you should remove it from:

Your PayPal account
Your password manager
To delete your passkey from your PayPal account:

Go to the Passkey Management page (you may be asked to log in).
Select the passkey you'd like to delete and click Remove This Passkey.
Once you have deleted your passkey from your PayPal account, you should also delete the passkey from your password manager (such as iCloud Keychain or Google Password Manager). This will prevent your device from providing deleted passkeys as autofill suggestions during future login attempts.

I tried to auto-fill my passkey from the browser, but I got an error. Why is this happening?
You may have deleted your passkey from your PayPal account, but not from your password manager (such as iCloud Keychain or Google Password Manager). Follow your password manager’s support documentation to delete the passkey from your password manager.

I created a passkey, but I am still being asked to log in with a password. Why is this happening?
Here are some reasons this could happen:

The passkey may not be available on the current device.

When you create a passkey, it is saved to a password manager linked to your device. If you try to log in on a different device that is not connected to the same password manager or that is connected to a different password manager account (e.g. different iCloud account for iCloud keychain), you will not be able to use this passkey. You can create another passkey on this new device.

The current browser or device may not yet be eligible for PayPal passkey login.

We are working on enabling new browsers.

Passkey login is available as a browser autofill option.

If you have a passkey available on the current device and the browser is eligible for passkey login, you will be able to use browser autofill to log in with your passkey on the password entry page.
I logged into PayPal and saw a message that a Passkey was automatically added to my
account. How did this happen?
With the new Passwords app in iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, websites and apps
can automatically upgrade existing logins to passkeys. When a user signs in to PayPal using
Password autofill, the iOS, iPadOS or macOS Passwords app can automatically detect if a
passkey is available and creates one.

To turn off this feature, navigate to the Passwords app settings and toggle off the “Allow
Automatic Passkey Upgrades”.

ips for creating a secure password
Tips for creating a secure password

Having a secure, unique password for each of your online accounts is critically important. If a scammer gets just one password, they can begin to access your other accounts. That’s why it’s important to have a strong, unique password for your PayPal login.

A strong password should have the following characteristics:

More than 8 characters long.
Use lower case, upper case, a number, and a special character ( like: ~!@#$%^&*()_+=?><.,/ ).
Not a word or date associated with you (like a pet’s name, family names, or birth dates).
A combination of words with unusual capitalization, numbers, and special characters interspersed. Misspelled words are stronger because they are not in the dictionary used by attackers.
Something you can remember.
How often should I change my password?

We recommend you change your password and security questions from time to time. There are a few cases where it's a good precaution, for example:

You notice something suspicious on your PayPal account.
You suspect that someone you don’t trust has your password.
You notice something suspicious in your email account or other online accounts.
You have recently removed malware from your system.
PayPal asks you to change your password.
If one of these occurs, change your Password, PIN, and security questions immediately. You can change these under personal settings.

If you receive an email asking you to change your password, it could be a case of phishing. Instead of clicking on a suspect link in an email, just log into your PayPal account by manually typing the URL. Once logged in, click Settings, and then Personal Info. You'll find the password, security questions, and PIN (if you've set one up) on this page.

What should I do if I lose my mobile device?
If you lose your mobile device, only someone with your PayPal username and password, or your PIN will be able to log in to your PayPal account. Be sure to keep this information secure.

Why am I receiving emails or texts from PayPal when I don’t have an account?
You may receive emails from us because someone registered a PayPal account with your email. They may have mistakenly typed the email address during sign-up or intentionally used an email address that wasn’t theirs.

A domain provider like Gmail or Hotmail may have also recycled your email address. If you have an email account and don’t use it for a while, the domain provider can reissue it to the public for use by someone else.

If you receive a message and are unsure it’s really from PayPal, always remember to check for the red flags shown in this video.




If you don't have a PayPal account but are receiving PayPal emails you can email us at UnsolicitedEmail@paypal.com.

You will need to:

Email us using the email address that you're receiving PayPal emails
Include a statement acknowledging you do not have a PayPal account and would like your email removed from the PayPal system
We can't reply to any general account questions or inquiries via the UnsolicitedEmail@paypal.com address.

If you do not have a PayPal account but you receive an SMS suggesting that you've attempted to log in, you can ignore these messages. It's most likely they are phishing attempts sent to random phone numbers.

If you do have a PayPal account and you're receiving these messages about log in attempts, at times you're not trying to log in, this suggests that someone has your password.

When you have Two-Factor Authentication set up on your account and any log in is attempted, we'll send you an SMS to confirm that it's you logging in. The SMS will come from one of our numbers, for example, 729725 or 72975.

This Two-Factor Authentication step must be completed before your account can be accessed. So, if you receive this SMS when you're not attempting to log in, we recommend that you log in to your PayPal account and change your password immediately.

How do I report potential fraud, spoof or unauthorized transactions to PayPal?

`
How do I spot a fake, fraudulent, or phishing PayPal email or website?
If you receive a message and are unsure it’s really from PayPal, check to see if it does any of the following:

Uses impersonal, generic greetings, such as “Dear user” or “Dear [your email address].” Our emails will always address you by your first and last names or by your business name. We never say things like "Dear user" or "Hello PayPal member.”
Asks you to click on links that take you to a fake website. Always check links in an email before you click them. A link could look perfectly secure like www.paypal.com/SpecialOffers. Make sure to move your mouse over the link to see the true destination. If you aren’t certain, don’t click on the link.
Contains unknown attachments. Only open an attachment if you're sure it's legitimate and secure. Be particularly cautious of invoices from companies and contractors you're not familiar with. Some attachments contain viruses that install themselves when opened.
Conveys a false sense of urgency. Phishing emails are often alarmist, warning you to update your account immediately. They're hoping you'll fall for their sense of urgency and ignore warning signs that the email is fake. If there’s an urgent need for you to complete something on your account, you can find this information by logging into PayPal directly.  
The following are common scams where fraudsters use spoofed emails.

"Your account is about to be suspended." Many fraudsters send spoofed emails warning you that your account is about to be suspended. The email will ask you to enter your password on a (spoofed) webpage. We’ll only ask you to enter your password on our login page. Always log in to PayPal and view the Resolution Center for any notifications.
"You've received a payment." Some fraudsters try to trick you into thinking you've received a payment for an order. They want what you're selling for free. Before you ship anything, log in to PayPal and check that you actually received a payment. We'll never ask you to share a tracking number by email. If you received a payment, you’ll always see it in your PayPal activity.​ 
"You’ve been paid too much." Fraudsters may try to convince you that they overpaid for an item. For example, they’ll send an email that says they’ve paid you $500.00 USD for a camera you listed at $300.00 USD. The sender asks you to ship the camera in addition to the extra $200.00 USD you were “paid” by mistake. The fraudster wants your camera AND your payment but hasn’t actually paid you at all. Before sending anything, login to PayPal and check that you received a payment. 
To report a suspicious email or website, forward it to phishing@paypal.com. After you send us the email, delete it from your inbox.

Most of us are careful if a stranger approaches us on the street and offers a deal that seems too good to be true. But we're much less cautious online, which can put us at risk.

Watch out for these common scams:

Phishing email/message
Invoice and Money Request scams
Advance fee fraud
Overpayment scam
Prize winnings
High profit – no-risk investments
Fake charities
Shipping scams
Prepaid shipping label scam
Package rerouting scam
Business/job opportunities
Reshipping packages scam
Employment scam
Other common scams


Phishing email/message/call
Have you received a suspicious email, or message, or been directed to a fake website? Forward it to phishing@paypal.com and then delete it. We’ll investigate it for you.

We will never call you from 1-888-221-1161 to ask you for your personal or account information.

Don't reply, open links, download attachments, or call any listed phone number.



Invoice and Money Request scams
These scams can happen in numerous ways:

You receive an invoice or money request through PayPal, but for a product/service/crypto that you never ordered. Don’t pay it.
You receive an invoice or money request through PayPal, and the bad actor has included an alarmist note asking you to call their fake customer service number.
You receive a fake invoice or money request by email, designed to look like a real PayPal email.
These scams are trying to trick you into sending money to a fraudster or providing your personal or financial details to them. Be wary of any messages that are alarmist, warning you to call them quickly to resolve an “issue” on your account.

How to avoid this scam: If you receive a suspicious invoice or money request, don’t pay it. And don’t call any phone numbers stated in the invoice note or open suspicious URLs.

Report any unwarranted invoices or money requests by logging in to the PayPal website or the PayPal app.



Advance fee fraud
If you get an offer for free money, there's probably a catch. Typically, fraudsters will ask you to send some smaller amount (for taxes, for legal documents, etc.) before they can send you the millions you’re promised, but which they never intend to send you.

How to avoid this scam: Don't wire money to someone you don't know.



Overpayment scam
A customer sends a PayPal payment that is more than the purchase price of the order, and then asks you to wire them the difference.
They may tell you that they accidentally overpaid you, the extra money is for the shipping costs, they're giving you a bonus for your great service or the money is for the stress they've caused you.
They may even ask you to wire the shipping fees to their shipper.
This scammer may have paid with a stolen credit card, bank account number, or checking account.
Even if a payment appears in your account, it might not be safe to spend it yet. If the legitimate account holder reports unauthorized activity, the money can be withdrawn from your account.
If that happens, you'll lose the money you wired to the fraudster, the product you shipped, shipping costs, and your payment.
How to avoid this scam:

Don't wire money to someone you don't know. A legitimate buyer won't overpay you for an order.
If a customer overpays you and asks you to wire them the difference, consider canceling the order—it's very likely to be fraudulent.
Don't wire money to the bogus shipping company—it's part of their scam to get your money.


Prize winnings
Messages asking you to pay a small handling fee to collect fabulous prizes are usually scams. You send the handling fee and get nothing in return.

How to avoid this scam: Don't send money to someone you don't know. A legitimate prize won’t require you to pay to receive it.



High profit – no-risk investments
These types of investments are usually scams and include messages insisting that you “Act Now!” for a great deal.

How to avoid this scam: Discontinue communication with this person/company.



Fake charities
Scammers use disasters to trick kind-hearted people into donating to fake charities. This usually happens when there is a refugee crisis, a terrorist attack, or a natural disaster (like an earthquake, flooding, or famine).

How to avoid this scam: Thoroughly check the background of any charity to make sure your donation goes to real victims. Spot and avoid common charity scams.

Use resources to check out charities, like the ones below:

http://www.charitynavigator.org
http://www.bbb.org/us/charity
http://www.charitywatch.org
If a charity does not have a website, be cautious. To learn more about common scams and how to avoid them, search online for advance fee fraud. You can also read the FBI's material on common types of scams. Most importantly: be as cautious online as you would be in the real world.



Shipping Scams
There are several ways fraudsters incorporate shipping into their schemes. Be sure you’re familiar with the following:

My shipping service scam

The buyer asks you to use their shipping account because they can get a discount, they have a preferred vendor they’ve worked with for years, or their shipping service is cheaper or more reliable. In another variation of the scam, the buyer may also ask you to wire the shipping fees to their preferred shipper.
If you use the buyer's shipping account, they can easily contact the shipping company and reroute the order to another address.
The buyer can then open up a complaint asking for a refund because they didn't receive their order.
You aren't able to prove that the buyer received their order and you are out your product, the shipping costs, and your money.
If they ask you to wire the money to a bogus shipping company, they can steal your money.
After you've wired the money, you’ll find out that the order was made with a stolen card or bank account. You might have to pay the money back to the legitimate customer whose account was stolen.
How to avoid this scam:

Only use your shipping account.
Never wire money to someone you don't know – you can't get it back easily.
If a customer asks you to use their shipping service, review their order for fraud carefully. They may have used a stolen card or bank account to fund the purchase.
Ship to the address on the Transaction Details page.


Prepaid shipping label scam
You receive an order from a customer who asks you to use their prepaid label to cover the shipping charges. (They may tell you that they can get their labels at a discounted price.)
By providing the label, the customer controls the destination of the package. They may send it to another country, a PO box, or some other untraceable location.
To be covered under PayPal's Seller Protection policy, you are required to ship to the address on the Transaction Details page.
The shipping label may also have been purchased with a stolen credit card.
How to avoid this scam:

If the customer asks you to use their pre-paid label, review their order for fraud carefully. They might have used someone else's stolen card to make the purchase.
Do not accept shipping labels from your customers.
Ship to the address on the Transaction Details page.


Package rerouting scam
The buyer reroutes the package so they can file a complaint that they never received it.

A buyer places an order and provides an incorrect or fake shipping address.
The shipping company tries to deliver the package but isn't able to.
The buyer monitors the online tracking information and notices that the shipper couldn't deliver the package.
The buyer contacts your shipping company and asks them to send the package to their correct address. The shipping company delivers the package to the new location.
The buyer then files a complaint about not receiving the item.
Because the shipment was rerouted, you can't prove the item was delivered to the address on the Transaction Details page.
The buyer gets to keep the item and money.
Because the package wasn't delivered to the address on the Transaction Details page, you aren't covered by Seller Protection.
Unfortunately, you lost the product, shipping fees, and money.
To make it worse, you might also have to pay your shipper an additional rerouting fee.
How to avoid this scam:

Contact your shipping company and block buyers from rerouting packages.
Validate the buyer's address before shipping.
Only ship to the address on the Transaction Details page.


Business/job opportunities
Fraudsters will post fake job opportunities on job-posting sites, dating sites, and via spam email.



Reshipping packages scam
One of the more popular work-from-home scams is reshipping electronics, clothing, and other items out of the United States.
You receive items (electronics, jewelry, clothing, etc.) in the mail and are asked to ship them out of the country.
Packages may be addressed to someone else's name (the stolen credit card victim).
Your "employer" provides you with a shipping label (also paid for with a stolen credit card).
Your "employer" asks you for personal information, such as your Social Security Number and bank account details, so they can "direct deposit" your check.
Generally, you’ll never get paid, and have just exposed yourself to fraud.
Most merchants will not ship items out of the country.
Fraudsters need you to act as an intermediary to help get the goods out of the country. It also helps them avoid getting caught.
They use your personal information to steal your identity or take over your account.
How to avoid this scam:

If it's too good to be true, it probably is. Know who you are dealing with and don't reship packages.
If you didn't realize you were involved in a scam until the packages started arriving, refuse delivery or return to sender. Report scams to the Internet Crime Complaint Center or contact your Postmaster.
Never give your private personal or financial information to anyone you don't know.


Employment scam
Someone contacts you about a great new business opportunity. They need an employee or partner to sell cameras (or some other expensive product) for them.
Scammers trick innocent and trustworthy people into sending them money and merchandise.
Use the money from the orders to pay their supplier. They’ll contact the supplier in advance to let them know you’ll be sending them money.
Update your PayPal account address to their address. They’ll usually give you an address that looks like a regular address but it's a P.O. box.
After you pay the supplier, you’ll start receiving complaints from your buyers stating that they didn't receive their merchandise. Instead, they received an empty box (from the scammer).
You contact the supplier. They inform you that your partner said you would be sending money for gold bullion, so they shipped the gold bullion (not cameras) to your PayPal account address. You remember that your partner asked you to change your PayPal account address to their address so that they could pick up the gold.
You paid the supplier for the cameras, so you filed a complaint against the supplier. Unfortunately, you learn that you may be liable for the money since the supplier delivered the merchandise to your PayPal account address.
How to avoid this scam:

If it's too good to be true, it probably is. Know who you are dealing with.
Don't list someone else's address on your PayPal account.
Make sure the seller is real before you send money.
Only ship items to the address on the Transaction Details page.
Be on alert if you’re asked to ship a lot of packages overseas or to the same post office box.

I don't have a PayPal account. Why did I get an email from PayPal that I received a payment?
PayPal is an account-based system that allows people to send online payments to anyone with an email address or mobile number.

If you received an email from us, someone may have sent a payment to you. You can accept the payment by clicking Sign Up on any PayPal web page. If you don’t have a PayPal account, you’ll need to create one before you can accept the payment. If you decide not to sign up for an account, we’ll refund the money back to the sender.

To report a suspicious email or website, forward it to phishing@paypal.com. After you send us the email, delete it from your inbox. 

To add an additional layer of confidence when receiving a payment, we now provide the sender of funds the option to share a link directly with the recipient that the recipient can use to access and redeem their money. 

The payment link connects the receiver of funds to a PayPal page that tells the receiver they have pending money and need to have or create a PayPal account with a confirmed email address to claim the money.

Why am I receiving emails about closing my PayPal account?

What are the most common scams on online marketplaces and classifieds websites?
Here are common warning signs that someone may be trying to scam you on an online marketplace or classifieds website: 

The buyer can’t meet in person (for example, they’re a soldier stationed overseas or a marine biologist). 
The buyer requested you send the item to their “shipping agent.” 
The buyer offered you more money than you were asking. 
The buyer asked you to send money through Western Union or MoneyGram to the “shipping agent.” 
The buyer only sends you text messages and won’t speak to you on the phone. 
If any of the above apply to you, end communication with your potential buyer.

If you’ve received a payment notification or are expecting a payment, you can check your PayPal activity to make sure we’ve credited the money successfully. Even payments that are on hold or pending are visible in your PayPal activity.

To learn more about online safety, visit our Security Center. 

To report a suspicious email or website, forward it to phishing@paypal.com. After you send us the email, delete it from your inbox.

`
What are invoice scams and money request scams on PayPal?
Invoice and money request scams often try to trick you into sending money to a fraudster. Or they may ask you to call their phone number, hoping you’ll divulge your personal or financial details over the phone.

Be wary of alarmist messages in invoices and money requests warning you to call them quickly to resolve an “issue” on your account. Always log in to your account on the PayPal website or the PayPal app to verify if any action is needed.

Invoice and money request scams can happen in numerous ways:
You receive an invoice or money request through PayPal, but for a product/service you never ordered. Don’t pay it.
You receive an invoice or money request through PayPal containing an alarmist note. The note may ask you to call their fake customer service number in the hope they can obtain your personal/financial details over the phone. It may look like this:
image of an invoice containing an alarmist note
You receive a fake invoice or money request by email, designed to look like a real PayPal email. Never click any links or call any phone numbers in a suspicious email. It may look like this:
image of a scam email containing an alarmist note

How to avoid these scams:
If you receive a suspicious invoice or money request, don't pay it.
Don't call any phone numbers in the invoice note or open suspicious URLs.
Never send money to a cryptocurrency wallet mentioned in an invoice or money request.
What to do if you receive a suspicious invoice:
Report any unwarranted invoices or money requests by logging into your PayPal account on our website or the PayPal app.

To report a suspicious email or website, forward it to phishing@paypal.com. After you send us the email, delete it from your inbox.

How to spot online shopping scams
Online shopping scams involve fraudsters setting up fake online stores or apps. They’re often advertised through social media or other genuine sites. Fake stores can even appear in your search engine results.

The stores may be selling popular clothing, footwear or electronics at temptingly low prices. Their website/app may seem normal, making you think it’s a legitimate store. But the stores often disappear within a matter of days/weeks. Sometimes you’ll receive a counterfeit item. Other times, you’ll receive nothing at all.

How to avoid online shopping scams:

Be wary of items that are below the market price. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.

Don’t trust an ad just because it appears on a popular social media site.

Check if the store has detailed info about privacy, disputes, and contact details like a physical address and phone number published on their website. Legitimate companies will usually have it.

Check prior customer reviews and the store’s social media profile. Legitimate stores typically have working social media links and an active presence on such platforms.

Look for anything that seems unprofessional, like spelling mistakes and poor grammar. The site may have been created using an online translator.

Example of a fake online store with prices below normal market value

Be wary of anything unusual during your checkout experience. For example, were you prompted to “donate with PayPal” instead of making a regular PayPal payment? Some fraudulent sellers will falsely claim that an “issue” with their PayPal account is causing the unusual checkout experience.

Scam websites often state that delivery takes several weeks and they don’t promptly provide a tracking number. Remember, you can report a problem in the PayPal Resolution Center.

To report a suspicious email or website, forward it to phishing@paypal.com. After you send us the email, delete it from your inbox.

What are ‘Friends and Family’ payment scams?
Many scammers now ask for payments to be sent through peer-to-peer (P2P) payment services.

In many locations, PayPal offers a ‘Friends and Family’ payment option for the everyday exchange of money between you and your friends and family. For example, when you send money as a gift, split a lunch bill, pay your share of living expenses, or something similar. PayPal also offers a 'Goods and Services' payment option for the purchase of goods and services from sellers you may not know. Goods and Services payments receive PayPal Purchase Protection.

Purchase scams
If a seller is encouraging you to send a 'Friends and Family' payment when you're buying a good or service, you should refuse. You could be dealing with a scammer who knows that your payment won't be covered by our Purchase Protection if it's a 'Friends and Family' payment.

Imposter scams
Be wary of actors claiming to be from government agencies or reputable companies. They may claim there's a problem with your account or that you owe money. To resolve this issue, they'll ask you to send a payment and/or provide personal info.

Romance scams
Fake profiles on dating apps or social media that strike up a romantic interest may be trying to gain your confidence and trust. They then make up a story and ask for money. Don’t mistake that for the real thing.

Extortion/blackmail scams
Be wary of scammers who claim to have compromising images or videos of you and threaten to share them unless you give in to their demands. Do not pay the blackmailer or give them more intimate content.

Completely stop all communication with the blackmailer. Block them from your communication channels. Report them to the social media platform, if applicable. Take screenshots of the communication and accounts involved to keep as evidence. Also, take screenshots and save the URL if any content has been shared online.

People affected by this type of conduct may experience feelings of shame, anxiety, or isolation. As a result, they may feel reluctant to report it or seek support. In many cases, this conduct may be a crime and there are resources available. If possible, confide in trusted family members or friends. If you’ve been a victim of sextortion, please report it to your local authorities.

Investment and cryptocurrency scams
Carefully consider requests that seem too good to be true, especially those related to investments and cryptocurrency. Promises of high returns and minimal risk can mean you’re being misled. Beware of complex investment strategies and unlicensed advisors. Please also see our Acceptable Use Policy.

Property scams
Scammers have been known to create fake rental listings and convince victims to send money as a deposit to secure the property. Please be aware that real estate, including residential and rental property, is not eligible for our Purchase Protection.

Someone using your card as part of a suspected “carding attack” at a PayPal merchant

If you recognize the activity we alert you about, then all good and you’ll be able to try it again.

In the meantime, we won’t freeze your card, so you’ll still be able to use it until you replace it.

If we detect multiple unusual attempts to use or add your card, your card is most likely compromised. In this case, contact your card issuer to report your cards as lost or stolen.
`,
`
Do I need to have the PayPal app to view details about any unusual activity?
Yes. You’ll need to have the latest version of the PayPal app installed to review details about the activity we blocked. If you can’t download and install the latest version, try checking your statements carefully and contact anyone who may have attempted to add or charge your card. You can also contact your card issuer for more help.

Can I request the erasure of specific information, such as my address?

No, you can’t select which specific data should be erased. Once a data erasure request is received, certain information is immediately erased while other information is progressively erased as it reaches the end of its retention period, culminating in the complete erasure of the user's information. In rare cases, information may be retained for a longer period in accordance with PayPal's legitimate interests. When processing erasure requests, PayPal aims to erase as much data as possible while remaining compliant with local laws and guidelines.

Do I need to submit multiple requests to delete multiple data entries?

No, you don’t need to submit multiple requests. A single request for data erasure is sufficient. Based on eligibility criteria, PayPal determines which data can be erased (as per regulatory laws and retention policies) and will inform you accordingly.

No, once data has been erased, it can’t be recovered. The erasure is permanent.

Can I withdraw a data erasure request?

If there's an amount owing to us, you can click on the "Resolve your balance that shows an amount owing to us" link next to your PayPal balance to clear it.

Is it required to close the account before deleting the data?

Yes, your PayPal account must be closed before we can delete your data.

`
How does data erasure work and what does it entail?
What user information does PayPal retain?

PayPal progressively erases information during the required retention period, culminating in the complete erasure of your information. While some data, such as marketing data, is erased immediately, other data may be retained in compliance with laws and for PayPal's legitimate interests, including preventing fraud and money laundering.

Why does PayPal need to retain user information?

By law, PayPal must retain some user data for a certain number of years to comply with legal and regulatory obligations. This is also done to help prevent fraud and money laundering, as well as for the establishment, exercise, and defense of legal claims.

Due to these reasons, PayPal can’t erase all of a customer’s information upon receiving a request. Federal, state, and local laws determine the length of time that data is retained. To learn more about how your data is collected, stored, used, and shared, refer to our Privacy Statement. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us.

Do data retention and management processes differ by country?

Yes, data retention requirements vary among different countries.

What are the statutory obligations for completing the data erasure process?

During the data erasure process, PayPal will:

Acknowledge your request.
Explain to you if we can’t immediately erase your data and why.
Adhere to the requirements related to user verification and timelines.
What are the eligibility criteria for data erasure?

To help us erase your data, you can take the following actions (as applicable):  

If your account is limited, go to the Resolution Center, select Go to Account Limitations, then click Resolve. Make sure any outstanding payments have cleared. We cannot close your account until all dues are paid.
Also, transfer your PayPal balance (if any) to your bank.
If there is a balance owing to us, click the Resolve your balance that shows an amount due to us link next to your PayPal balance.
If there are any disputes on the account, wait for them to be resolved. 
Just a reminder that even after closing your account, we may still need to retain some of your data to comply with our data retention obligations.

For Brazil: If you owe an amount to us, click the Pay what you owe link next to the amount.

What are the stages that an erasure request must go through?

Once you have requested data erasure, we will check your account's eligibility. After the eligibility check, we will notify you whether your account qualifies for erasure or not.

What are common reasons why a data erasure request may not be completed?

The most common reasons for a non-qualifying account are account limitations, outstanding payments, a positive balance, or an amount due towards PayPal.

What happens if a data erasure request can't be executed immediately?

The data erasure request requires the account to be closed, triggering the start of the data retention period. PayPal will acknowledge the user's request for erasure and take action to start the erasure process; however, erasure will only be completed for data that do not need to be retained, such as marketing materials. At the end of the data retention period, the user's information would be automatically erased, except for rare circumstances where PayPal has legitimate interests in retaining it for longer.

What credentials are required to validate the identity of the person who requests data erasure?

PayPal can only accept erasure requests from the legitimate data owner or their heir/ authorized representative. To validate the identity of the person requesting data erasure, PayPal checks their credentials and requires them to pass two-factor authentication (2FA) successfully.

How are erasure request status updates communicated?

After submitting a data erasure request, you'll be notified via email at the address provided during the request submission. It's important to note that this email address cannot be modified once the request has been submitted.


How can I check the status of my erasure request?

You'll be notified about the status of your requests through email. You should also check your email Spam folder for any missed communication before contacting PayPal. However, if you have not received any notification, you can contact PayPal Customer Service to get the status of your request.

Does PayPal automatically erase retained data?

Yes, PayPal will erase the data if it qualifies for erasure after the retention period as per the policies and regulations.

After making an erasure request, can I request a Data Access Report (DAR)?

Yes, you can request a data access report while also requesting data erasure. However, once the account is closed, you cannot download or request a DAR copy of your information through PayPal’s self-service online system, but you can still make an offline request by contacting us through our public website.

How do I contact PayPal's Data Protection Officer (DPO)?

PayPal's DPO can be contacted through the Contact us section, and details can be found at Privacy Hub.

How do I contact PayPal Customer Support regarding my erasure request?

You can Contact us. Learn more about how your data is collected, stored, used, and shared in our Privacy Statement.

Search privacy settings
Search Privacy settings give you control over how people can search for you when they want to send you money or request money from you.

What changed?
With our new settings, if someone searches for you and finds you in the search results, they’ll see your PayPal profile photo and any other info you make public in your profile settings. If you take no action, your information will be searchable starting September 5, 2023.

Privacy Tip!
Turn these settings ON if you want to make it easier for people who want to pay you or request money from you to feel confident that they’ve found the right person.

Turn these settings OFF if you don’t want people to find you in the search results when they enter your info. They’ll still be able to pay you with your QR code or send money to your email address or phone number, but they won’t get verification that you have an account on PayPal before sending the payment.

Here’s how it works:
There are 3 new settings now available (these will go into effect on September 5, 2023):

Personal profile info lets people within the PayPal network search for you by name, email, phone, or username when sending you money.
PayPal.Me link lets anyone outside of the PayPal network send you money using your unique link.
Payment requests let people search for you by name, email, phone, or username when they want to request money from you.
How do I manage my Search privacy settings?

Go to Profile.
Select Data and privacy.
Select Search privacy.
From there, choose how you want people to search for you by toggling your controls on or off.

If I toggle my privacy settings off, can people still search for me or send me money?
Turning off all your privacy controls means that if someone searches for you on PayPal, they won’t get verification that what they searched matches with an existing account. They can still send you money if they know your phone number or email or they can scan your personal QR code, but they can’t see your name or profile photo in search results.

What’s going to happen to my old search privacy settings?
If you previously had one or more preferences turned off, you will continue to see the old privacy settings and be found in search results according to the previous settings you had chosen.

`
What should I do if I said I didn’t recognize an attempt that I now believe is legitimate?
Contact us and we’ll help you through the next steps. On the other hand, if you mistakenly said you recognized an attempt that was actually fraudulent, you should contact your card issuer immediately to report your card as lost or stolen. Then contact us and we’ll help remove your card from the other PayPal wallet, if necessary.
`,
`
Why did I receive a notification about a charge for a small amount?
Fraudsters will often make small-dollar or zero-dollar charges to see if a card works. This is known as a “carding attack.” If it works, they may sell the card or use it for larger purchases.
`,
`
Why did I receive an alert that another account approved or rejected unusual activity?
If you’re sharing your card with another PayPal wallet, the other cardholder can respond to alerts about unusual activity.
`,
`
Do I need to do anything to activate the early fraud alerts feature?
No. We will monitor your PayPal Wallet. You’ll receive real-time alerts and daily updates in the app simply by having your card in a PayPal Wallet, excluding the PayPal-branded debit and credit cards.

How do I create a shipping label to return a purchase to the seller?
This article has information related to purchasing shipping labels from the Shipstation. If you purchased your shipping label through the PayPal Shipping Center, visit our PayPal Shipping Center for more information.

If your seller has turned on the return label feature, you'll be able to print and pay for a domestic or international return shipping label from your PayPal account.

The returned item must be in the same condition as when you received it and you’re responsible for any costs associated with the return. If you’re shipping internationally, please mark “Returned Cargo” on the outside of the package to avoid tax charges.

We suggest you retain a copy of the shipping label to verify the address of the recipient. If needed, we may ask you to provide this document later.

Here’s how to create and print a return shipping label:

Go to Activity and select All Transactions.
Click the payment for the item you want to return.
Scroll to the bottom of the “Transaction Details” page and click Return Shipping Label.
Complete the form and click Continue.
Make sure the information is correct and click Pay and Continue. Your PayPal account is charged for the label.
Click Print in the return label pop-up window.
We'll send you and the seller an email with tracking information to confirm that you're returning the item.

Tips:

Before you create your return shipping label, ask the seller about the return and refund policies.
If you choose a different shipping company than the seller used, re-enter your address and shipment information. You can create one return label per transaction.

`
How long can the seller take to ship my item?
This article has information related to purchasing shipping labels from the Shipstation. If you purchased your shipping label through the PayPal Shipping Center, visit our PayPal Shipping Center for more information.

We encourage sellers to ship items as soon as they receive payment. Most sellers ship items within 7 days. (Allow extra time for international shipments).

Occasionally, a seller may contact you if an item is out of stock. At that point, you can decide if you want to wait longer for that item or request a refund.

Depending on the shipping service the seller uses, you may be able to track your item online. If the seller prints a shipping label using PayPal, you can see the tracking number and shipping status when you select that transaction in your Activity.

If you don't receive your item or it's different than described, you can request a refund. If your seller doesn't agree to refund your money, you can open a dispute.

`
What is proof of shipment?
Proof of shipment is an online or physical documentation from a shipping company that includes the following:
The date the item was shipped.

The recipient's address, showing at least the city and state, or city and country, or zip/postal code (or international equivalent). The address information on your shipping receipt must match the address on the Transaction Details page.

Log in to your account and go to the Resolution Center, where you will be guided through the exact steps on providing the proof of shipment or proof of delivery.

`
What's Shipping Short Pay? (Underpaid Postage)
This article has information related to purchasing shipping labels from the Shipstation. If you purchased your shipping label through the PayPal Shipping Center, visit our PayPal Shipping Center for more information.

The USPS uses Automated Package Verification (APV) to confirm that all shipments match the details on the label. If you entered incorrect package weight, package size, or destination address, it could result in underpaid postage. If you haven't paid enough to cover the postage for your package, USPS will deduct the differential amount of the label automatically from your PayPal account. If you've overpaid, it'll refund the excess amount automatically to your PayPal account.

What if I don't agree to the underpaid label charges?
You can see the adjustment report from your "Settings" page in ShipStation. If you think you were charged for underpaid postage incorrectly, you'll need to contact USPS directly at verifypostagehelp@usps.gov to dispute the charges.

How can I avoid underpaid postage?
Follow these tips to avoid underpaid postage:

Weight - Make sure that you report correct weights while purchasing labels. Always round off your weights to the next number. For example, a weight of 7.2 oz is 8 oz and not 7 oz.
Dimensions - Report accurate dimensions when purchasing labels. Dimensional weight (volumetric weight) may apply to your packages and providing correct dimensions will help you avoid underpaid postage.
Correct address - Make sure that you enter the correct address and correct zip code. Any discrepancies in this would result in extra charges.
Match the label to the packaging - USPS provides a wide range of shipping options to help you meet your mailing needs. Make sure that the label you're using matches the packaging. For example, if you're using a flat rate box, you should also use a flat rate label. Similarly, anything in a priority mailbox requires a priority mail label.
Double check the zip code - Confirm that the origin address is up to date, and you've marked the correct zip code for the destination.

What can I do with PayPal package tracking?
The PayPal app can provide live shipping updates for your purchases so you know where your packages are and when they’ll arrive.

With Package tracking, you can:

Track packages automatically and manually, whether or not you bought them with PayPal.
Track packages shipped worldwide, from the biggest online stores to the small shops you love.
Where can I find the Package tracking feature?
It’s exclusive to the PayPal app, and you can find it anytime in a couple of places. On the Home screen, tap on the menu in the upper-left corner and find Package tracking in the list. You can also go to Activity and tap the Package tracking tile at the top of the screen.

How can I track packages automatically?
All you need to do is link your Gmail to Package tracking – just make sure it’s the one where you get your shopping emails and order confirmations.

How does automatic Package tracking work?
Essentially, Package tracking acts as your shopping assistant. It will check your inbox for shopping and shipping updates, so you don’t have to. It finds packages and organizes them for you into a list with live updates. Plus, you’ll get notifications along the way letting you know what’s up with your packages and when they should arrive.

How do I track packages manually?
Enter the tracking number and carrier, and we’ll provide live updates. 

How does Package tracking comply with email provider policies?
Google: PayPal’s use and transfer of information received from Google APIs for package tracking will adhere to the Google API Services User Data Policy, including its Limited Use requirements.


Outlook: PayPal’s use and transfer of information received from Microsoft APIs for package tracking will adhere to the Microsoft APIs Terms of Use policies.

What’s the difference between the “In Progress” and the “Delivered” lists?
Packages shown in the in Progress tab are still on the way. The Delivered tab shows what’s arrived and when it was delivered – think of it as a history of past packages.

What do “Prepping,” “Shipped,” “Out for delivery,” and “Delivered” means?
These statuses reflect the latest info we have from the carrier:

Prepping – The seller created a shipping label and is ready to send your items.
Shipped – The carrier has your package, and your items are now on the way.
Out for delivery – Your items are likely on a delivery truck and are close to arriving.
Delivered – Your package has arrived.
Please note: when it comes to shipping packages, things are constantly moving, so these definitions might not accurately represent the exact status of your package at all times.

Is Package tracking only for PayPal purchases?
No, this feature is designed to help you track your packages in one easy place, including things you purchased with or without PayPal.

Will my PayPal purchases get Package tracking automatically?
You may get package tracking for some things you buy with PayPal, but not everything just yet. Over time, you’ll notice that more of the things you buy with PayPal come with package tracking.

Are there any packages I can’t track?
As long as it’s shipped with a tracking number from a carrier, we can help you track it. Sometimes online stores like Walmart and Amazon don’t provide tracking numbers for specific packages, so you won’t see them in our PayPal app.

How do I create a shipping label?
This article has information related to purchasing shipping labels from the PayPal Shipping Center. If you purchased your shipping label through Shipstation, visit our Seller Tools for more information.

You can purchase and print a label on the PayPal Shipping Center Buy a Label page when your order is ready to ship.

How to access the Buy a Label Page
You can access the Buy a Label page in one of three ways:

In the PayPal Shipping Center, click Buy a shipping label in the actions menu for the order you want to ship.
From the Order detail page, click the Buy a shipping label button on the top right.
From the Activities transaction list in your PayPal account, click Print shipping label.
How to Create a Domestic Label
To create a label on the ‘Buy a Label’ page:

Select your shipping location if you have added multiple shipping locations in PayPal Shipping.
Your customer’s Ship To address will automatically populate from the order details.
Fill in the requested information (confirmations, insurance, or additional handling requests) about your shipment in the ‘Package and Weight’ section.
By default, USPS and UPS include insurance coverage up to $100 for specific services. You can add more insurance coverage to your shipments for an additional fee.
Click the Calculate rates button.
Select your desired shipping service. The ‘Shipping Services’ section displays your available service choices.
Click the Buy Label button to purchase the label.
You will be directed to the ‘Order Summary page,’ where you can review your shipment details, and shipping costs and select your funding instrument from your Wallet to purchase the label.

Click the Download icon on your browser's print screen to download your shipping label and save the PDF file to your computer.
Note:

You can go back to the ‘Ready to Ship screen’ to create labels for more orders, go to the ‘Shipped screen’ to review the order information, view or reprint your label, or void the label if needed.
If you need to ship an order in multiple boxes, you can create additional labels for the order from the ‘Order Summary page.’
How to Create an International Label
Here's how to create an international shipment:

Go to your ‘Orders’ page.
Click the order number and select your Ship From address.
Calculate shipping rates and select a shipping service.
Add a Customs Declaration form.
Purchase a label.
Note: First-class mail international labels cannot be refunded and are not trackable.

A Customs Form declares all items in a shipment when it crosses international borders. Customs agencies require Customs Forms to help them regulate the flow of goods in and out of each country. You must create customs declarations for each unique item in your shipment. Multiple quantities of the same item can be declared on a single customs declaration.

For all carriers, these forms are submitted digitally to the carrier on the user’s behalf. However, for UPS, the user will be provided with 3 copies of the UPS Commercial Invoice. Even though this was submitted digitally to UPS on a user’s behalf, we recommend that the user prints these forms and affixes them to their shipment to prevent any issues when handing off the shipment to UPS.

Customs declarations include the following information about each line item of a shipment:

Description (Required when shipping to Mexico)
Quantity
Item Value
Total Value (if quantity is more than one)
Harmonization Code (Required for shipping to EU Countries)
Country of Origin
Note: Make sure the description of your item is as detailed as possible. If the contents are not described in enough detail, the shipment may be returned to you (the sender) by the carrier or the receiving country. The carrier will not issue a refund for the postage cost when a shipment is returned. Your description should include at least what the item is and what it's made of (for example, "cotton t-shirt" or "gold bracelet"). If it's a specialized item, you may also want to include what it is used for (for example, "stainless steel cookware skillet").



How do I create a shipping label without an order?
You can create a shipping label independent of a PayPal order in the PayPal Shipping Center.

Click the Buy Quick Label button on the Shipping Center home page.
Enter your recipient's shipping address and information.
Fill in the requested information for the package.
Click Calculate rates.
Select your desired Shipping Service and click Buy label.
Select your payment method and complete the purchase. Your label will open in a new tab.
Note: You can find your past purchased quick labels under the "Labels" tab on the Shipping Center home page. From this tab, you can view, reprint your label or void it if needed.

Change the Label Layout
Your label layout settings tell the PayPal Shipping Center what type of printer you are using, allowing it to create the label in the correct format.

There are two available layouts for shipping labels in PayPal:

8.5 x 11 inch: Select this option if you use a desktop printer with letter-size paper. If you buy multiple labels at once, this option will print two 4 x 6-inch labels per page.
4 x 6 inch: Select this option if you use a thermal label printer.
To set or change your label layout:

Log in to PayPal.
Navigate to your Account Settings.
Go to your shipping preferences.
Click Change under ‘Shipping Label layout.’
If you have already created labels in an undesired label layout size, you must void and repurchase those labels to apply any label layout changes.

What is an adjustment and how do I dispute?
This article has information related to purchasing shipping labels from the PayPal Shipping Center. If you purchased your shipping label through Shipstation, visit our Seller Tools for more information.

Post-billing or postage adjustments are changes to the amount paid for a particular shipment by a carrier, such as USPS or UPS. These adjustments can result in additional charges or refunds to your account, depending on the adjustment.

If you are charged a post-billing adjustment, we will automatically try to charge your PayPal balance or the payment method used to purchase the original label. If we are unable to complete the transaction, you will not be able to purchase shipping labels until the outstanding balance is paid. Once you sign into your PayPal account, there will be a banner notification to assist in paying the balance.

There are several reasons why a carrier would make postage adjustments, including but not limited to:

Incorrect package weight or dimensions: If the weight or dimensions of a package are inaccurately measured or reported, the carrier may adjust the postage to reflect the actual weight or dimensions.
Incorrect package type: Certain carriers may have specific rules regarding the package type shipped, such as envelope or box, and may adjust the postage accordingly.
Incorrect destination or address: If the destination or address of the recipient is inaccurate or incomplete, the carrier may adjust the postage to reflect the correct destination.
Additional services requested: If additional services are added, the carrier may adjust the postage to reflect the cost of these services.
How do I pay for an undercharged shipment?
To pay your outstanding balance:

Click on the link in the email you received.
Or Shipping Landing Page.
Click More Actions.
Click Go to adjustments.
Follow these tips to avoid underpaid postage:

We recommend carefully reviewing and accurately reporting all package details when sending shipments to avoid unexpected postage adjustments.
Weight—Make sure you report the correct weights while purchasing the labels. Always round off your weights to the next number. For example, a weight of 7.2 oz is 8 oz, not 7 oz.
Dimensions - Report accurate dimensions while purchasing labels. Dimensional weight (Volumetric weight) may apply to your packages, and providing the correct dimensions will help you avoid underpaid postage. Read more about dim weight here – https://www.usps.com/dimensionalweight/
Correct Address – Make sure you enter the correct address and correct zip code. Any discrepancies in this would result in extra charges.
Match the label to the packaging—Our shipping partners provide a wide range of shipping options to help you meet your mailing needs. Make sure that the label you are using matches the packaging. For example, if you are using a flat-rate box, you should also use a flat-rate label. The same goes for priority packaging. Anything in a priority mailbox requires a priority mail label.
Double-check the zip code: Verify that the original address is up to date and that you have marked the correct zip codes for the destination, too.
How do I dispute an adjustment?
You are not able to dispute a shipping adjustment directly with PayPal. Instructions for disputing an adjustment vary by carrier.

To start the adjustment process, navigate to your Adjustments, select the adjustment you would like to dispute, and then click on the Dispute Adjustment button. A screen will pop up that will provide you with the next steps and an effortless way to copy and paste your transaction details.

How do I void a PayPal shipping label?
This article has information related to purchasing shipping labels from the PayPal Shipping Center. If you purchased your shipping label through Shipstation, visit our Seller Tools for more information.

If you need to cancel a label for any reason, for example, the order gets canceled after you’ve created it or made a change to the Ship To address, you’ll void the label from the Labels screen in the PayPal Shipping Center. You can then create a new label for that order if needed.

Refunds for voided labels will automatically be applied back to your PayPal account. Once a label is voided, the void cannot be undone, and the voided label cannot be restored. Depending on the carrier, it can take up to 21-28 days for the funds to be returned.

Void Eligibility
If a label is ineligible for voiding for one of the following reasons, the Void Label button in the PayPal Shipping Center will not be available.

USPS labels can be voided until 28 days after the label creation date.
UPS and DHL Express labels can be voided until 30 days after the label creation date.
Labels that have already been accepted by the carrier cannot be voided.
USPS First-Class Mail Large Envelopes/Flats labels are not eligible for refunds and cannot be edited.
USPS First Class Mail International Labels do not include tracking information and are not eligible for refunds.
What is a USPS SCAN form?
A USPS Scan Form (Shipment Confirmation Acceptance Notice) summarizes all the USPS shipments you've created in a day. It has a barcode that USPS will scan when they collect your shipments. This helps them avoid scanning each package individually and allows USPS to accept your shipments more quickly. The maximum number of shipments that can be included on a single SCAN Form is 500.

Although not required, it's recommended to use SCAN Forms when shipping multiple orders. To generate a SCAN form, you need to create two or more USPS labels in one day. SCAN Forms are not available for UPS shipments and cannot be updated after it’s been created.

Note: When dropping off your packages at a USPS Post Office, or when USPS arrives to pick up your packages, make sure to present the USPS Scan Form and included shipments to the USPS personnel. All shipments must be sent on the same day that the label is created, before 9 PM local time.

How do I create a USPS SCAN form?
To Create a SCAN form:

Visit the PayPal Shipping Center.
Go to the Ship Packages button on the Shipping Center page, then click the Get USPS SCAN form.
Any SCAN Forms that are eligible to be created for your purchased labels will be listed under Create SCAN Form. Click Create to generate the form you want to use.
Your SCAN Form will be available on the USPS SCAN Form page for 4 days after it has been created. Click the Print button to print your SCAN Form again.
Note:

You can create a SCAN Form for shipments with a current or future Ship Date, but you can't make a SCAN Form for a Ship Date that has already passed.
You can create multiple SCAN Forms per day if you have more than one pick-up time.
Only shipments with tracking (delivery confirmation) are eligible for USPS SCAN Forms. USPS First-Class Large Envelope/Flat shipments can't be included on SCAN Forms because it's not a trackable package type.
If you need to cancel a label added to your SCAN Form, you can still void it if the shipment hasn't been accepted by USPS.
What if I void one of the labels included in the USPS Scan form?
The SCAN form is no longer valid.

How can customers pay my invoices?

PayPal customers can easily pay your invoices. In most countries, they don’t need a PayPal account to pay. They can pay you with their PayPal account, Venmo, Pay Later, and credit or debit card.

Can customers make partial payments?

To accept partial payment from your customer, check the Allow partial payment box under payment options when you’re creating an invoice.

This lets your customers make multiple payments toward the total amount of a single invoice.

If you require a minimum amount due, your customer will need to pay at least that amount in their partial payment.

Your invoice will have a Partially Paid status until it’s fully paid. A record of payments will appear on the invoice details.
Partial payments aren’t a credit product or a way to allow for an excessive number of payments. We may contact businesses if we suspect they’re not using this feature correctly.

What if customers can’t find my invoices?

If your customer can’t find their email notification for an invoice, their email filter might have sent it to the junk folder.

If your customer has a PayPal account, they can pay the invoice by logging into their account where they’ll see the invoice in their Activity. If needed, you can reshare a link to the unpaid invoice with your customer.

Learn how to share an invoice link.

Can I send reminder emails for unpaid invoices?

To send a reminder about an unpaid invoice, find it in your list of invoices. On a desktop computer, click the three-dot icon and click Remind. On a mobile phone, you can send reminders from an unpaid invoice’s details page. You can personalize the reminder before sending it. Your customer will receive an email reminding them to pay the invoice.

To save time, set up automatic reminders for all new invoices in your Invoicing settings. You can also schedule automatic reminders warning customers when an invoice is overdue.
